Post 1: 9 ways to lower cortisol levels and prevent stress
Content:
 

### [Stress](https://www.vmira.com/stress-and-ways-to-overcome-it/) is the body’s response to a potential threat that may be related to physical and psychological factors. Learn about the role of cortisol in stress and how to lower cortisol.

Cortisol is one of the hormones produced by the adrenal cortex. It is involved in many metabolic processes, such as helping to regulate blood pressure and blood sugar levels. In addition, it plays a role in the awakening process after sleep. When you wake up, your hormone levels rise, peaking after [30 minutes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3581252/) and then gradually decreasing throughout the day.

Cortisol is also called the “stress hormone”. When your body feels threatened, physically or psychologically, your brain sends a signal to your adrenal glands, and they release cortisol in response. This hormone improves concentration, blood circulation, and glucose synthesis – this helps the body release additional energy to cope with stress more effectively.

Despite the benefits of cortisol, frequent or prolonged increases in cortisol levels can be harmful to the body. For example, chronic stress causes cortisol dysfunction, which leads to inflammation, depression, and accelerated cell aging. It is also associated with the development of osteoporosis, muscular dystrophy, and decreased antitumor immunity.

>**Chronic stress occurs as a result of repeated exposure to situations that result in the release of stress hormones, including cortisol.**

We’ve compiled nine evidence-based ways to naturally lower cortisol levels and manage stress. This will help your body to experience a state of mobilization less often to eliminate a potential threat.

*This article is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be used to diagnose or treat or replace professional advice.*

## 1. Identify the factors provoking stress

Threats to life or change of scenery are irritants that provoke anxiety and can become a trigger or stress factor. These irritants include physical pain, relationship or work problems, and financial difficulties. It is, of course, impossible to predict when you will hit the chair with your foot. But some types of triggers can be learned to recognize.

 

One of the first steps to relieve stress is to understand what is causing it. I don’t want to remember and think about unpleasant situations. But a stress diary can help you recognize stimuli so you can be less responsive to them. It is not necessary to remember all the details of an unpleasant event – it is enough to write down the fact and try to analyze why the incident caused you a negative reaction.

With a stress diary, you can find practical ways to deal with these situations. For example, avoiding quarrels, learning to build personal [boundaries in relationships](https://atlas.ru/blog/5-prichin-pochiemu-zdorovie-i-samochuvstviie-chielovieka-zavisit-ot-liubvi/) and at work, and saying “no” in time. Moreover, you will be able to identify hidden causes of stress like hanging on social media.

## 2. Learn to recognize thoughts that cause stress

Reflecting on negative and traumatic events is a trigger for the synthesis of cortisol. British scientists conducted a [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453012002557?via%3Dihub#bib0015) in which participants recorded their most negative memories for 20 minutes over three days. The results showed that this caused the participants to have high levels of cortisol. [Scientists](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022399905002151?via%3Dihub) attribute this to long-term effects on the entire body.

 

Also, the scientific community highlights the role of anxiety and looping on negative thoughts in stress levels. [It has been proven](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00971/full) that negative thinking not only increases cortisol levels but also badly affects the production of oxytocin, a hormone that calms the nervous system.

The mental practice of mindfulness is one way to combat negative thinking and helps lower cortisol levels. Hungarian scientists conducted a [meta-analysis of](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17437199.2020.1760727) ten studies on the relationship between meditation and stress hormone levels. The results showed that meditation has a positive effect on people living under stressful conditions, but especially on patients with depression and PTSD.

## 3. Pay attention to the quality of your sleep.

A person who has slept well will find it easier to deal with the effects of stress and unpleasant situations. But it’s not just the quality and duration of sleep that affect cortisol levels. What time you go to bed and wake up also plays a role. Research [shows](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453012002648) that people who work night shifts and sleep during the day are more likely to have elevated cortisol levels.

Shift work under the age of 40 is associated with a higher body mass index (BMI) and higher cortisol levels.

Cortisol can be elevated due to lack of sleep, especially in the evening after a lack of sleep. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system is responsible for the production of cortisol. When a threat to the body appears, a part of the brain, the hypothalamus, synthesizes special substances that are sent to the pituitary epididymis. He, in turn, sends a signal to the adrenal glands. In response, the adrenal cortex releases cortisol, some of which again enters the brain, affecting the thinking process. This relationship between the brain and the kidneys is called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also responsible for regulating sleep cycles. Stress, illness, or poor nutrition can activate the axis. Subsequently, this can worsen your sleep and increase cortisol.

Sleep hygiene is one of the deciding factors in its quality. Try to create an environment in which the amount of noise and light is minimal. This will help blackout curtains, eye masks, earplugs.

**Tips for Improving Sleep Quality to Reduce Cortisol Levels:**

* Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time.
* Wash bedding and sleepwear regularly – fresh scent helps the body to relax
* Try not to use devices that emit blue light (TV, phone, tablet) 2-3 hours before bed
* Avoid caffeinated drinks in the afternoon
* Avoid excessive strength and cardio activities two hours before bed.

## 4. Exercise regularly

Exercise can either increase or decrease cortisol levels, depending on the duration and intensity of the exercise. Despite the benefits of playing sports, it is still a load and stress for the body. Therefore, as a result of intense exercise, cortisol usually rises briefly, but then falls at night.

At the same time, moderate-intensity exercise does not lead to an increase in stress hormone levels. Like vigorous exercise, moderate exercise is associated with a decrease in cortisol levels at night.

With regular exercise, cortisol levels can be controlled. And in addition to lowering the stress hormone, sports have a good effect on the microbiota. But it’s best to avoid strenuous evening workouts that will keep you awake. Physical activity isn’t just good for the body – many doctors recommend it to improve mental health as well.

## 5. Find something to do

Learning how to relax is really beneficial, especially if you want to manage stress. A new hobby is one way that also helps you learn a new skill. It doesn’t matter what you do, the main thing is that you enjoy the activity

 

American scientists conducted a [study of](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26030115/) 50 former combatants who experienced depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or substance abuse. They practiced gardening and occupational therapy for a month. The results showed a decrease in stress and a decrease in cortisol.

Think about what activity you will enjoy – perhaps it is drawing, music, or gardening.

## 6. Laugh often.

Laughter is good not only for the soul but also for the body. It is a natural way to overcome stress and reduce cortisol levels. [A study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080407114617.htm) published in 2008 found that even the anticipation of laughter leads to a decrease in blood levels of cortisol, as well as two other stress hormones, adrenaline, and norepinephrine.

>**Laughter lowers not only stress hormone levels, but also blood pressure.**

If you are having a fun and interesting time, you are unlikely to experience a lot of stress at the same time. This is why it is so important to plan your time and visit interesting places and events.

## 7. Communicate with animals

It has been scientifically proven that contact with animals is associated with decreased cortisol levels. Scientists have [studied](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24170391/) how interaction with animals affects stress and found that long-term interaction with dogs, even strangers, as well as pet ownership, has a positive effect on cortisol levels. In addition, the interaction between man and dog increases the level of oxytocin in both.

 

Pets are associated not only with reduced stress levels but other health benefits as well. For owners of cats, dogs, parrots, and other pets, it is easier to focus attention. Also, animals have a positive effect on blood pressure and help to avoid feelings of loneliness.

## 8. Add cortisol-lowering foods to your diet.

Nutrition affects not only metabolic processes in the body but also the level of cortisol. Certain foods, such as sugar, can increase the amount of stress hormone.

Neurotransmitter chemicals are responsible for transmitting signals to the nervous system and controlling mood. And hormones and food are responsible for their production.

**How to reduce cortisol through nutrition**

Foods rich in polyphenols can help reduce stress hormone levels. For example, the long-term health benefits of drinking green tea are scientifically proven – drinking as little as half a glass a day reduces the risk of depression and dementia.

Eating the foods in the table below will help control your stress hormone levels:

**FoodBeverages**BananasBlack teaDark chocolateGreen teaPlant fibersProbiotics (yogurt)Probiotics (sauerkraut)Water

Remember that seizing stress only provides temporary relief and can lead to eating disorders, weight gain, and blood sugar problems. During times of stress, try to choose foods containing plant fiber – fiber provides a feeling of fullness for a long time and regulates blood sugar levels.

Regular sugar intake is associated with long-term high cortisol levels and is associated with a higher risk of heart disease in overweight men.

**Probiotics**

The gut microbiota contains trillions of bacteria that are beneficial to your health. They strengthen the intestinal lining, fight inflammation, regulate the immune system, and even mental health. This is why it is important to take care of the composition of the gut bacteria.

Among the inhabitants of the gut microbiota are probiotic bacteria that reduce cortisol levels and, consequently, stress. Among them are the bacteria *Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus* and *L. farciminis.*

Probiotic foods help maintain healthy gut bacteria. Dairy drinks like kefir and yogurt, as well as fermented foods like kimchi, contain certain strains of probiotic bacteria. They help reduce stress-induced cortisol levels. [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28101105/) shows that one Lactobacillus strain, *L. Plantarum 299v,* reduces exam stress in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

With the [Atlas Microbiota Test,](https://atlas.ru/microbiome/?utm_content=/blog/9-sposobov-snizit-uroven-kortizola-i-predotvratit-stress/) you can learn about the bacterial diversity of your gut as well as assess the level of probiotic bacteria.

## 9. Spend time in nature

The noise of the big city, rush, and traffic jams are part of the life of many people, but not everyone realizes the degree of the negative impact of such an atmosphere on physical and mental health. Even a park or nature reserve within the city limits is a great opportunity to recover and relax.

 

Forest therapy is a part of life for most Japanese people. They call her “shining-Youku” which translates to “forest baths.” This is the practice of walking in a park or forest for 2-4 hours, which includes contemplation of nature and deep breathing. As [proved by scientists](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19568835/), this pastime reduces cortisol levels, normalize heart rate and blood pressure.

>**Deep breathing reduces heart rate, improves mood, and reduces stress.**

There is no one-size-fits-all method of dealing with stress – every organism and brain is unique. Good sleep, proper nutrition, and regular physical activity are the basis for a healthy body. Now you also know what other scientifically proven ways to prevent and reduce stress.

**Make a note:**

1. Identify stress triggers
2. Learn to recognize thoughts that cause stress
3. Pay attention to the quality of your sleep
4. Exercise regularly
5. Find something to do
6. Laugh often
7. Get a pet
8. Eat more cortisol-lowering foods
9. Spend time in nature

Post 3: Does anybody else stressed even if they are "relaxing"?
Content:
Even if I have nothing on my hands and I just try to relax I'm still on edge. I've been constantly stressed for 3 years and I just can't take it anymore. I cant feel positive emotions anymore and I just feel like a robot

Post 4: Everything is going to be ok
Content:
To anyone out there who struggles with stress, anxiety or just the constant bombardment of life’s obstacles, I’m here to tell you that everything is going to be ok.

As someone who has battled life’s stressors, as well as falling down to rock bottom several times, I can promise you that these hard moments you’re going through are only temporary. Nothing is permanent. Your pain and hardships are merely a fleeting moment through time that presents itself to define your future self. 

Remember that every difficult moment of your life has now become a distant memory that in some minor or major way, has shaped who you are today. Be proud of that. Embrace it. We all wear scars underneath our skin and we’re bound to be wounded again in the future. That’s just how life works.

Some people are lucky enough to just “coast” through life without having to deal with financial stress, heart aches or other bullshit that life throws. But I’ll tell you what. Some of the most interesting people I’ve ever met are those that have faced anxiety and stress. 
You are one of those interesting people. Never forget your worth.

Take each day as a stepping stone toward your goals. Don’t see a mountain as a giant hunk of rock to climb. See it as a bunch of little steps that may take a little while to reach the top. But you will eventually get there. It’s inevitable. And sure, some parts of the mountain will be harder to climb than others. Some days are going to suck. You’re going to want to cry and curl up in a ball because life’s too hard. And that’s 100% ok.

But remember, as long as you keep pushing forward, you will succeed. And baby steps are ok, in fact they are usually better than unpredictable long strides. If you have a bunch of shit you have to do today, or this week or this year try to aim to complete 1 important task per day. Make a list. Cross tasks off your list as you complete them. Make your bed every morning, that’ll automatically give you a headstart for the rest of your day. Get rid of negative, toxic people from your life. You don’t need that shit. All you need is you to get through life. 

Whoever you are, stay strong. You will get through this. Just breathe. And listen to Into the Black by Chromatics. Great music to calm down to. 

Post 5: Does anyone else feel CONSTANTLY stressed?
Content:
My whole life I’ve always felt stressed. Say I’m super stressed about getting an assignment done the night before and I *do* get it done, I never feel relaxed. The same “stressed” feeling stays. I always feel like there’s something I could be doing with my time. Does anyone else feel like this?

Post 6: I feel absolutely overwhelmed
Content:
I'm the boss at work. My wife, the absolute love of my life, looks to me for advice and to be the one to ultimately make tough decisions. All day every day is, "Hey, what do we do?"  I'm a 6'2" 205 lb "tough guy", based on general stereotypes. I'm the rock. But lately I feel totally overwhelmed. Our planet is fucked. This pandemic isn't going away and I'm surrounded by deniers and anti-vaxxers ar work. My wife is having relationship problems with her sister. This morning I woke up at 430, which is pretty average for me, but my wife woke up, too, and asked if I was Ok. I guess she felt something different from other mornkngs. I got up and went downstairs to make coffee, worked out and then I just broke down and cried. I've never felt as overwhelmed as I do now. I don't have the answers. I'm not gonna harm myself or anyone else or anything like that, but I'm fucked.  I don't know what to do.

Post 7: Does anyone else kind of fantasize about killing themselves when they get really stressed?
Content:
So I'm really not a depressed person at all, probably more the opposite, but when I am in a really stressful situation at work (especially when I mess something up) I honestly feel like killing myself. I wouldn't do it because I have a wife and kids, but can anyone relate to this feeling? It's especially strong when I feel like I'm not good at my job.

Post 10: Burnout ( Fatigue Syndrome ) symptoms to watch out for!
Content:
Hey my friends,

So I hit the wall October of 2019, and was diagnosed with Fatigue Syndrome here in Sweden where I live. The result of too much stress for too long, trying to work while also starting up my own company. I didn't listen to all the warning signs and I burned myself out.

Here in Sweden where I live, we have quite a good official medical information website that describes different diseases and what symptoms to look for. So I did a video summarizing it for the disease Fatigue syndrome, commonly also referred to as burnout. At least here in Sweden!

I DON'T want other people to reach the stat I have.. Still on sick leave and severely impacted by this. TAKE IT SERIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE TOO MANY STRESS SYMPTOMS!

[https://youtu.be/f6VY1DrNeTI](https://youtu.be/f6VY1DrNeTI)

&#x200B;

EDIT: ADDED TEXT DESCRIPTION;

Exhausted or burnt out? IN SWEDEN, Nowadays, the diagnosis of fatigue syndrome is used to describe the consequences that prolonged and severe stress can bring. In the past, other terms such as fatigue depression or burnout were used to describe the condition. This labeling may differ from country to country, But the main cause is the same - STRESS

What is Fatigue Syndrome? For the most part, the body can handle stress if you only get enough time for recovery. Fatigue Syndrome means that you have several different physical and mental disorders due to long-term stress or other severe stress. With support and treatment, you recover, even though you may be stress-sensitive for a longer period of time. For some, the recovery takes a long time.

A consequence of prolonged and severe stress If the balance between stress and recovery for an extended period of time does not work, the body can begin to damage. Often this is noticed by the body trying to signal in various ways that the stress level is too high.

Different phases of the disease The disease can be divided into three stages: • the pre-stage • the acute phase • recovery phase.

In the pre-stage there is the possibility to prevent the problems from getting worse. The problems you get from the stress before you get fatigue syndrome are a precursor to the disease. By already trying to make changes that reduce stress, you can prevent yourself from getting worse. Sometimes you may need help from someone else.

Symptoms

The symptoms of fatigue syndrome are almost always both physical and mental. Most often you have also had one or more stress-related problems for a long time before you get sick. Which or which symptoms are most evident in fatigue syndrome varies from person to person. It is common to have several of the following problems:

&#x200B;

Fatigue and sleep problems

• You have no energy and experience great fatigue that cannot be rested or "sleept away" 

• You feel exhausted. 

• You have difficulty falling asleep in the evening or wake up many times during the night. 

&#x200B;

Emotional symptoms 

• You are easily irritated, worried and down. 

• You have anxiety.

&#x200B;

Mindful symptoms 

• You forget things and have trouble concentrating. • You have problems planning and executing tasks.

&#x200B;

Physical symptoms 

• You have physical problems such as palpitations, dizziness and pain. 

• You are very sensitive to sound. ( the silverware ) 

• You can get various types of stomach and intestinal discomfort.

&#x200B;

You can get sick very suddenly

The illness itself often goes slow and the problems develop over time. But sometimes the symptoms come very quickly and clearly. For example, you may suddenly find it difficult to orient yourself or do common things such as unlocking a door, reading a text or following a conversation. You may also suddenly feel confused, have strong anxiety or dizziness.

Common with stress sensitivity and guilt 

You are often very sensitive to all kinds of stress. It is also common to feel guilt and shame. You may also feel unsuccessful and depressed if you are unable to cope with your work, your studies or your everyday life.

Depression

People who have fatigue syndrome may also have depression. But not everyone with fatigue syndrome gets depressed.

Take care of yourself!

I love you buddy, take care! Don’t stress, live your best!

Post 12: Why can't I handle things as easily as other people?
Content:
Not sure if this is the place to ask but I don't understand why I can't handle a lot of things at the same time or deal with a lot of stress without becoming depressed and passively suicidal. I have friends who juggle 3-4 different jobs, are in grad school, and still manage to enjoy their lives by hanging out with friends, taking mini vacations, and just in general are still able to be happy.

I, on the other hand, can only handle being in grad school part time and having one part time job that's only 2 and 1/2 hours a week. Anything more on my plate throws me into a depression where I hate my life and wish I can just escape from it all.

It was even like this in college and when I was younger in high school. I couldn't handle many extracurriculars or after school jobs cause it would wreck me. 

So I guess I'm asking - why? If anyone knows what could be the source? If anyone experiences the same?

Thanks :)

Post 13: Had a meltdown today
Content:
Today I was criticised for being too slow at work. It’s the first time in 15 years of my job that this has happened. Usually I’m early hitting my targets. And it hit me hard. I literally felt trapped and exploded with rage after the meeting. 

Why, I hear you ask, did this happen, and why did I explode? 

In December, as the icing on a cake of shit, my wife had a car accident. She had a seizure  whilst she and out youngest (21 months) drove home from her work/his nursery. They were both ok, but the car was written off and she was instructed that she couldn’t drive for 6-12 months pending a neurological investigation. (She’s epileptic and this was one of two seizures she’s had… in twenty years)

So, I was tasked with taking and picking up our eldest to school, and our youngest to nursery. A round trip of about 1hr 45 mins (together). On top of working a stressful job in computer graphics in a senior role. 

With inflation hitting living expenses, rising costs of fuel etc, my anxiety over those is at a high worrying we’ll never be able to move house as our current house is now too small for a family of 4. 

This is, of course, on top of covid. In December 2019, we lost a close friend to cancer, then 2020 covid hit. My wife lost her mum, aunt, and uncle in the space of two weeks at the end of March/early April, then we lost a family friend. The following week, we had our second child… the same week, I lost my permanent job of 12 years. We also lost another close friend and then my wife’s cousin passed away. 

I scrambled to make ends meet in a part time teaching role, but had to also look after our two boys as school and nursery were closed down. 

It has honestly been the worst 2 years I’ve ever experienced. And today, stressed with the constant task of getting my kids to school/nursery, I hit rock bottom. 

I won’t say I contemplated suicide because I couldn’t do that, but I was certainly left with the sense that there is basically no way out. I’m trapped. 

I don’t know what the fuck to do to be faster at my job when I’m already doing a 14 hour day between sorting out the kids with my wife, and working.

Sorry for the rant. It’s been a fucking horrible two years. Roll on spring and hopefully some kind of resolution to this fucking shit

Post 14: Is anyone so stressed about their job they are more stressed at home anticipating it than actually at work?
Content:
I’ve been at my new job for a little over a month, and still am trying to learn everything right. My manager is very unpredictable in his moods and impatient which makes it hard to ask questions or ask what my next task is. When I make any kind of mistake he can make me feel terrible about it. 
Because of this I get home and just worry about how much I will have to interact with him the next day and mistakes I might make in front of him. Does anyone have similar experiences?

Post 17: Has anyone felt so bad with stress they had 24/7 tension&felt like they were stuck in flight/fight mode?
Content:
I’m actually wondering for years now if it’s possible my vagus nerve got damaged even. I’ve mentioned it to Drs,I do a lot of googling because been having health issues so long. I tried to do meditation but my brain is too fogged up,can’t focus,always forget&put things off. My personality,mental state&physical just crapped out at the same time although physical things bothered me prior.I’ve been trying to avoid asking for clonazepam as I only wanted to take it in emergencies but people constantly make me worse. I lost 7lbs past 2 weeks stress frm pple while sedentary. 

Eating has been a big struggle because don’t really have an appetite but try to have something like a bowl of cereal daily.I wonder if my dry mouth I’ve had the past 15yrs is possibly stress because never got an answer for the cause but that’s when things started,just got dramatically worse with more things bothering me. I just want Drs to say this is your issue take this&do this but instead I got diagnosed with quite a few things but not the 1 I’m looking for which is really my brain working&feel like myself again with this 24/7 tension gone.

As in actually physically sick? I don't think I'm the only one but I kind of feel like it.

Post 19: Losing at life
Content:
I feel like I am losing at life. I can’t seem to get anything right. I fail at projects at work. I have no friends. My relationship failed. I am always paying debts and bills. I oversleep. I forget to eat. I feel so lost and disconnected from reality. I am a shell of the person I used to be.

Post 20: Do you ever want to quit everything
Content:
I just want to quit everything. To do nothing for some time, to feel relaxed. I dont remember how this feels.

Post 21: Today I've decided to elimate my biggest stress factor : my daytime full-time job.
Content:
I decided not to show up. I'm not going back.
I worked there for 3 years and I've always felt like a soulless being once I entered the job.

I was making $17 an hour at this place, 40 hours a week, $500 after tax. for now I'll be doing ubereats making $20+ an hour.. I will be my own boss and work my own time (temporarily) 

I know they will be pissed because I'm the only one at this place including the manager that does what I do, but when they presented me a 50 cent raise, I screamed inside. 

I finally broke free and I feel a little bad about my decision today, but in the long run I know my mental state will be in a better position. 

I can finally drive my wife to work, and drop off our daughters in school and in the afternoon pick my daughters up and then pick my wife up. This brings me joy. 

I know how hard it is for my wife to dress two kids in the morning, take public transportation when it's really really cold, raining, snowing outside. That's really hard. 

I pray everything goes well from here on.

Post 22: Has anyone get the urge to gag/throw up when overwhelmed with stress?
Content:
Lately this has been happening a lot, it is most likely college, and I’m also having trouble getting sleep because of my messed up sleep schedule of going to sleep at 7am and waking up at 5pm. At the moment I’m trying to reset my sleep of staying up all day till the late afternoon to sleep. I don’t know if this is the right way to go to help myself to sleep. I for sure know that today is going to be really stressful and the gaging will be consistent when I dare to yawn or even open my mouth when I talk. I know the usual tips of helping myself is in r/sleep but I’m hoping I’m not the only one with this symptom( that it isn’t a bad sign).

Post 23: Overwhelmed Easily
Content:
I have been in the job for about 2 months. I'm doing relatively good. My boss said that my performance is great and I'll be getting a pay raise next month. Problem is, I get overwhelmed easily. If I make a mistake however small, I panic and make even more mistakes till I shut down entirely and give up. My colleagues say that I overreact (which doeasn't help) and the job is very easy and comfortable to the point that they got bored of it. I can't relate to that at all. I have to keep up with a lot of different projects and understand a lot of technical details since I'm a sales engineer. I always ask a lot of questions which annoys everyone. My boss hates it yet he always throughs any project at me. Keep in mind I'm a fresh graduate and am navigating through a new field. Having a master's degree and a business to work on doesn't help the situation. I don't know how to deal with stress and approach problems in a calm manner. Sometimes I feel like I'll just burst at some point on the job. Any suggestions?

Post 27: How to deal with Anxiety setbacks (advice from a former sufferer who has recovered)
Content:
I know what you may be wondering, "I was doing so well, I thought I might be able to beat this thing...but then all of a sudden, my anxiety symptoms just came back with full force. I feel like I've made no progress at all."

These were my thoughts almost every other day when I was struggling, and once I figured out how to handle these bad days, I exponentially began having better days.

I wanted to give some on how to deal with setbacks and recover. I recovered without any meds, or supplements btw. I focused on acceptance, exposure, and patience (I talk more about recovery below).

1. Recognize setbacks are a part of recovery. Many people think recovery is linear, like healing a broken bone. Truth is, recovery is more like 2 steps forward, one step back...and sometimes, its like makes 2 steps forward and 4 steps back. THAT IS A SETBACK. It's easy to think you haven't made any progress. But you have. Recognize setbacks are vital to recovery.
2. Setbacks get less intense over time. The better you get, the more resilient your nerves become. Some setbacks will be worse than others, but the main focus is not trying to figure it all out. Overtime, the intensity of setbacks decrease, and the gap between them widen until, good days and bad days feel the same...where every day is an amazing day.
3. Worst thing you can do during a setback is go back to your old habits. If you start google searching, going on forums, getting assurance from doctors...what you are really doing is trying to figure something out so that you stop these feelings. It's a sophisticated form of avoidance. Allow yourself to feel the setback and know it's part of the process.

I've created a video to really dive deep into the steps of recovery in the link below. I also talk about what I did to recover in way more depth in the link below.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFrqgegSsKQ&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFrqgegSsKQ&feature=youtu.be)

I hope this inspires some hope and minimizes much of the confusion around setbacks.

Best of luck to you all.

I am 22, and I started a new job 2 weeks ago, where I work from home, doing mainly administrative tasks. I’ve started hating it - I have a lot of work and since I am new everything takes ages to finish. I am getting so stressed to the point that I think about work all the time instead of enjoying life. I quit my previous job after 5 months because I also found it to be stressful (there I had a lot less work and looking back it was not stressful). Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this stress? Also any ideas on less stressful jobs? I feel like I am stuck in the corporate cycle and not sure how I can get out. I can’t seem to find a job which I would enjoy

I'm not very good at my job. I've been there about six years and have been promoted a could of times. The money is quite good, which makes it really hard to leave. Internally I feel like I'm melting down. I think it's really starting to affect my brain chemistry. I couldn't stop worrying about work when I took a week off a while back. My boss seems to hate me for some reason (I've never antagonised her, I roll over on stuff just to keep the peace). I feel pathetic and the job is making me hate myself. I became a father about seven months ago. I'm worried that I will raise my child in a stressful home, but what's the alternative? I can leave my job, I need to support my family.

Post 32: Does anyone else get sore aching legs and body pain from being in a constant state of worry and stress
Content:
I’ve been super stressed and anxious lately because of a lot of stressors at home plus feeling like I have no one to share them with. My family has been going through insane amount of financial issues and debts so I don’t know if this is a cause // effect. 

In the past 5 months I’ve diagnosed myself with all types of cancers ( because I had blood in my stool due to hemmoroids ) I’ve had swollen nodes in my neck etc. 

My body has acted out in all kinds of ways over the past few months and I’ve been visiting all doctors where nothing major has been diagnosed but I can’t stop worrying. I had got my blood work done 3 months ago and it was all good, now with the body pain I feel like getting it again because I feel like some new cancer mah have developed. 

The past week has been literal hell where my muscles are constantly extremely aching. My legs have been so sore, I wake up every night from 2 AM to 5 AM with leg // stomach pain and anxiety attacks plus my guts have been churning and I’m constantly worrying about things. 

Has anyone else got these symptoms weird anxiety symptoms ? Sometimes I don’t even realise that I’m clenching my leg muscles they ache so much. 

Sorry for freaking out and posting about all of this. I’ll appreciate some good vibes / validation

Post 34: On days that I work, my body subconsciously gets stressed out that I am going to miss my alarm, and this results in me waking up repeatedly, to the point I don't get enough sleep

Even though I *know* I've set my alarm, and the sound is on, several hours into falling asleep I will wake up semi panicked that I've missed my alarm, and am late for work. Today I woke up at 12ish, 2, 2:30, 3, 3:30, and finally I couldn't sleep anymore so I got up at 4. Every time I wake up I scramble to find my phone so I can check the time. (I am also already a very light sleeper so this doesn't help)

It's awful. I just get this awful stress right before going into work, and this has been manifesting more and more, and now my eye is twitching (which for me is a stress sign) 

And it only happens on work days. On my days off I sleep so good, it's amazing.

Currently my eye is twitching, my tummy is upset to the point of feeling sick, and I've just got this stress/anxiety. Wtf is this about. It's awful.

Content:
Hi there, so this playlist (available at both Apple Music and Spotify) came to life almost a year ago, when I'd finished researching the effects of listening to nature sounds.

Easily explained:You may have heard about our inherited fight-or-flight response system, which is a major factor in stress and anxiety. Well, research has shown that listening to nature sounds triggers the opposite system, called rest-or-digest, which helps lowering your heart rate, ease tightening muscles and enable you to focus on fewer things. These system is, just like our f-o-f response, is inherited from our ancestors. We believe that reason behind nature sounds triggering this is that hearing birds, rain etc meant positive things for the caveman generations. Birds singing meant that there were no large predators around (as well as good soil), rain meant crops would grow, fire that they would survive the night and so on.

Hope this helps everyone it reaches!

Post 43: Dizziness / vertigo from stress - anyone else?
Content:
Hi,

I've had light dizziness / vertigo for about a month now. It began during a very stressful time where I was waiting (over the holidays) for news on whether I'd got a new job or not. I really wanted to leave since I have a somewhat aggressive and stressful boss. I could hardly sleep for a week; woke up every single night and got like 4 hours top.

Anyway. I got the job (yay!) but I've had this dizziness since. Now, it's not a severe vertigo or anything - so menieres disease or BPPV are out of the question - but it's a feeling of instability. Like if I'm on a boat or a flight. Sometimes I get second-long spells where the dizziness is worse.

Anyone else? Do you have any tips? Is it the stress that's the cause or could it be something else? Neck problems? Computer vision syndrome? I'm also tired constantly, no matter how much I sleep, which I assume is connected.

Post 45: Facebook is so freaking Toxic now
Content:
It’s not even just the opposing political posts from different sides of the family, the countless sponsored ads with the plethora of negative comments, or people only out to promote their agenda with no regard for what anyone else shares... 

It’s that you can’t even comment on a friend’s post without fighting. 

I didn’t think my comment was harmful but apparently I insulted her lively hood and don’t understand anything about journalism; all from 2 fucking sentences.

To clarify: she posted an article and commented about how the title was misleading about the article- it was about the ship of people coming back from China and the screenings for the coronavirus. I don’t remember it exactly - I didn’t read it, I heard about the ship coming in and them screening people and possibly quarantining them already - but basically the title made it sound like a certain number of people were already quarantined, while the article itself said they were just screenings and not quarantines, or something to that affect. 

So I made a comment about the news tending to be misleading and taking things with a grain of salt. Because a lot of times it IS. And I know that you have to check multiple sources to get the full idea (though if multiple news stations can be bought into saying basically the same thing, then you are still only getting one version... but that is a whole different ballgame) 

But anyway, she responded to my 2 sentence comment with 2 fucking block paragraphs about how the news isn’t misleading but you can’t just read the titles and expect to know the whole story (that isn’t misleading?) and how journalists like herself try her best but people don’t bother to read the full story (which I also agree with), and how it’s people’s fault (meanwhile I’ve seen news articles paint a version of events to come off in certain ways - young black boys being called “men” and teenage white rapists being called “boys” - and before anyone starts I am a WHITE FEMALE (25) so don’t you dare give any sort of “supporting your own race” excuse to dismiss this; this is journalism bias. Anyway). 

The news is always biased, and it can be misleading (whether due to bias or painting their depiction of events to sound better instead of getting to the damn point). I know this. I thought she did too but I guess working in journalism changed that. Idk. She’s always been very liberal (I prefer to stay as close to the middle as I can) so I’m surprised she went off on me like that... 

Idk, I’m at the point in life where I’m not gonna try to please people. And I need to just say fine, fuck it, and burn these bridges that are just too stressful to maintain now. (I’m not like gonna block her or anything but I’m not arguing. I don’t have the mental strength for it, even if I had wanted to. Just logged out and gonna deal with my own shit)

Post 46: Is chronic stress really that powerful?
Content:
Hey guys, I’m a 34 year old male who has generalized anxiety, and it seems to have gotten worse in the last couple of years. I think a combination of anxiety and stress has totally destroyed my health since around 2020. I went from losing a bunch of weight through dieting to then gaining a ton of weight back, especially in my midsection and chest, being unable to lose any weight now, having painful and sometimes debilitating reflux (though a scope has shown minimal damage and no real physical defect), and lately I’m having minor panic attacks at work. 

I genuinely feel like this nonstop anxiety and stress has destroyed my health. I’m trying to meditate each day and limit my caffeine and alcohol consumption, but I still feel very stressed and anxious. I think I’m stressing and worrying myself sick since all of my lab work and visits with doctors have come back without any real results. 

This sounds like an excuse in some regards, but I can’t deny how terrible my health has been for the last few years. Something about the pandemic plus work stress seems to have really messed me up, and I’m not sure how to recover. Thanks in advance for any advice or words of wisdom.

Post 49: Physical symptoms from stress
Content:
I’m wondering if anyone has ever experienced anything like this before.. I was very stressed 2 years ago with a new job, a move, covid etc and ended up having an episode where half my body went numb and it took a few months to recover. I had weakness in my legs, sharp pains, hand joint pain, headaches, numb toes (raynauds) and pretty severe fatigue. Got a bunch of tests done for autoimmune diseases and everything came back clear. I eventually recovered but now every time I get remotely stressed weird symptoms return - it always starts with a twitch in my back and then I get burning sensations on my skin, weak feeling legs, shortness of breath, fatigue. Mentally I feel like I handle stress pretty well, before all this I would deal with stressful situations and come out unscathed. Now it feels like my body falls apart at the slightest stressor. Any idea what this could be?

Post 51: How Stress Can Kill You
Content:
It may be shocking, but it\&#39;s true. Yes! Stress may kill you if not attended on time. Regular and prolonged stress is the main factor that leads to heart disease and other chronic disorders. Almost every other disease has its roots in stress, whether directly or indirectly, but stress has a role in your health problems. Hence [stress management](https://insightfulcounselling.com/22-different-techniques-to-reduce-stress-you-wish-you-knew-earlier/) is very important to lead a healthy life.

Let's check out more details.

Stress is one of the key reasons that may damage your nervous system. It is the reason for a constant release of adrenaline. This continuous release of adrenaline by stress hormones results in damaging physiological aspects of your body.

Stress is a crucial contributor to increased risk of heart disease, other cardiovascular issues, high blood pressures, and causing difficulty in breathing.

It damages your immune system and further leads to harmful conditions like burn out, anxiety, panic attacks, heart attacks, strokes, memory loss, insomnia, extreme anger, depression, and other mental illnesses.

Many of the aforementioned disorders may eventually prove fatal if not addressed on time.

Stress can be caused by anything. Workload, exam pressure, deadlines and targets, high debts, any fear or phobia, extreme anxious feelings, relationship issues, or even a sudden fight may trigger stress and anxiety.

By now, it must be clear that it's not precisely stress that kills you, but it is the way your health and body respond to stressful events.

Therefore, once we successfully cope with and manage our stress levels, we can be relieved.

Post 54: Just needing a place to vent
Content:
My 2017 was just a pile of crap. I had multiple family members die, our dog got hit by a car, I got investigated at a job and fired because someone made up rumors about me, got fired from a second job for no reason, and finally got into sales on strictly commission. Then there was a hurricane. We lost our home, so all of our stuff is in storage and we are living in a bedroom with family. Sales started good and now it’s dead. 

We have nothing. We have negative hundreds of dollars in our bank account because of auto-pay bills with $15 cash to our name and I won’t get paid again next week. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve looked for other jobs, but nothing matches my previous salary that we built our bills around. Our credit is bad and relatively new, so we can’t refinance cars right now or skip payments and we can’t get loans because my partner doesn’t make enough and I haven’t been at this job long enough. I don’t know what to do. I can’t get a second job because I work nearly 52 hours a week. My partner works full time and uses the downtime to do the laundry for me and run the other errands I can’t during the day. I’m just at an impass. Our family members don’t have money for us to borrow. We have no credit cards.

I just feel like everything is spiraling down and I can’t control any of it. I was hoping 2018 would be better, but so far it isn’t.

Anyway, if you’ve stuck with me this long, thanks for listening. I hate to burden my family with this kind of stuff because I feel guilty. I know there are are people who have absolutely nothing. I have clothes on my back and a roof over my head, but I’m still worried because I don’t have gas money to get to work or buy groceries. It’s just a very helpless feeling.

Thanks again to anyone who is reading this. I appreciate you.

I’ve known it for years that I’m not going to right direction. But when it finally happens it’s overwhelmingly awful. Burning out.

For me years of work stress finally manifested as burnout through multiple physical symptoms. 

In one month I went from stressed but working into being on sick leave and suffering from Tinnitus, Heartburn, Heart Palpitations and insomnia. Leading back to increased anxiety and depression. 

I went from not having medication into anti depressants, stomach meds, sleeping pills..

I’m also doing therapy which I tried to to do with meditation to avoid medication but seems like I need all help now.

I hope this encourages people to listen your stress and seek help before it gets worse. 

Also if there’s any words of courage from people maybe gone through this please share. As you might now currently I am super afraid and anxious that this will never go away.

I had so many issues I was already dealing with before Covid-19, the near-economic collapse, riots, political corruption and election stuff, etc.

I'm living in a dump of a place, caring for an elderly person and an aging pet and I've got health issues myself.

Our state is one of the highest in the nation for infections/deaths from Covid-19 so when I developed a cough and low-grade fever, it felt like just one more kick in the guts. After going to the ER, turns out I just have an upper-respiratory infection and my lungs were "perfectly clear" according to the Doctor I saw. Still, it was scary!.

Then there's the news (I read way to much) and every day it seems like there is some kind of political crookery going on or we *might* go to war with China/Russia or the end of the world is near...blah...blah...blah. So sick of everything. I wish we could go back to 2019 or even 2018 or something. Any year but the one we are in now.

Post 60: Chronic Stress Symptoms and Recovery
Content:
So I've been experiencing what I can only think is chronic stress over the last 6 months.  For others who have had chronic stress (3 months+) what were your symptoms like and how long did it take to recover?

Symptoms:

\-Brain fog

\-Chronic headaches (everyday almost all day. Gets better towards night.)

\-Blurry vision

\-Middle of the night insomnia

\-Irritability

\-Constant worrying

\-Memory problems

\-Concentration problems

Recovery:

\-Meditation/Mindfulness

\-CBT

\-Nootropics

I feel like I've been getting a little better over the past 2 months but barely.  Seems like a very slow process so I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if it's could be something completely different.

Post 62: I am sick of being stressed all the time but cannot overcome it
Content:
I’ve been stressed out from a very young age, because I always had the feeling that I needed to be perfect, so I would stress over anything I did, school, hobbies, how other’s perceive me, what I say. Up until junior and senior year of high school the stress and anxiety I got from talking to other people was so powerful that I just wouldn’t do it. If I did I would go home and overthink every single word, it was exhausting and to be honest these are the most vivid parts of my childhood and teenage years, the amount of stress I would feel. I tried to change when I went on to uni, the social anxiety part got better, not solved but better, and yet i found stress in everything else, especially after finding out my uni had rankings and that there would be benefits like better exchange programs etc. Then the pandemic and the war in Ukraine made it even worse (i’m from eastern europe very close to Ukraine) 

I’m tired of being stressed all the time, for the past 4 years I’ve seen physical effects of it as well. I had heart palpitations for a while, two years ago I started stress eating, i wake up feeling exhausted, I have episodes of nausea and headaches. I just want it to stop and everytime i think I’m on the right track it comes back stronger and I genuinely cannot see an end to this. A lot of it comes from self doubt and not feeling good enough. Does anyone have any tips on getting over this? I’m worried that if I go on like this I’ll see even worse physical effects in the future.

**Hey Folks!**

**I’m a family medicine/neuromusculoskeletal physician. I keep seeing the same thing in my clinic....upper back/neck pain and headaches! So much of this is related to stress! Im always asked how can I improve my pain without undergoing painful procedures or utilizing medications. I want to be able to help more people than I can see in my clinic so I want to put together a free video to help people start feeling better. Would anyone be interested in this?**

I get anxious about things like people downvoting my posts or saying negative things to me.

There is a series that has it's own odd logic, like milk being used to have a character's tooth grow back (as I was reminded of nicely.)

I then mentioned how lately in this series, a character's skull has become cracked (it showed an x-ray type of shot of it and everything.) And I asked if milk would be enough to heal this character's cracked skull this time.

And someone responded to me with "Oh, so you're a shit poster then. Or just stupid."

I don't know if its because of my autism or because of me or what, but I sometimes get told negative things on the internet by others, and it really brings me down a lot..

I’m a senior in hs and I’m suppose to graduate this yr but I need an English credit and currently I have 4 days to write a 9 page essay. It isn’t in the grade book with how many points it is worth. I have a 72% now so this is probably gonna make or break my grade. my final is only worth 10% of my grade but I need at least a 62% to for sure pass. I’ve done the outline on my paper but still haven’t gotten a grade and I turned in the topic I chose twice and still haven’t gotten a grade. Mind you these were turned in dec. 19th and last Friday. Now I’m sweating bullets about getting this thing done because I spent all last week catching up on web design and this week 3 of my finals start plus I have to turn in mandatory study guides before I can even take the final.  

The thing that’s mostly stressing me is my parents are counting on me to be the first to graduate and I don’t wanna let them down but this paper is so difficult it took me a week alone to get the outline done and now I’m sitting her procrastinating. I don’t wanna get a bad grade on it but I don’t wanna not do it and it fucking sucks.

Content:
I feel like I’m always surrounded by people who seem to be so care free. They never worry about anything and wave their hand at any problem they seem to come across. Basically the “who cares, if it happens it happens” mindset. It makes me envy those people because I feel like I’m always worried about every scenario and “what if this what if that?” Is it possible to change into that mindset of not caring or worrying about something until or when it happens? I’ve tried so many times but can’t seem to get there. My mind is over analyzing every possible scenario 24/7 and idk how to stop. I feel like if I come across a situation that is out of my control, my mind just freaks out and I loose sleep and over analyze every possible scenario and the only way to be calm is to not be in that situation to begin with.

I'm making a little over 70k a year at a hospital and I am being priced out of Denver CO. I got a big raise this year but it feels more like a pay cut because I find I can no longer afford what I use to. Rent has gotten so out of hand my brother and I made a deal to rent a house together so we can save money. We both gave up our apartments not only to save money, but because the homeless crime is out of this world here in Denver. He makes over 100k a year and can't afford to buy a house. What is going on!? We both went to college and have good jobs. I can't comprehend how people are making it. I don't have kids and I couldn't imagine if I did. No baby formula and kids getting shot up in school. No thank you. I'm stressed because I'm really taken aback by all the nonstop nonsense and struggling.  My Roth IRA is now losing money!?!? Wtf my retirement was supposed to be solid now I don't believe anything I was told growing up is real. My stability is being shaken and I don't believe in the USAs ability to keep it together. I think we are gonna fall down worse and apart. What do you think? 

How are you guys making it? Are you moving? Should I move? Are you guys starting to drown like me?!

Post 72: Is it normal to feel incredibly tired after a stressful situation is over with?
Content:
I was enduring one of the most many intoxicating situations that was causing me so much stress that I didn't realize. It has been going on/building up since about a year ago now. It was causing me to never be able to sleep even with heavy sleeping pills. I just would not be able to sleep as I was shaking anxious, stressed, overly tired, etc.

Well this situation has finally been put to rest and I have become at peace with my life. But I have noticed, instead of the night owl I am, I have been sleeping like a rock for the last week and a half. Mind you, I LOVE it. Bit I notice I have been getting tired at 9pm instead of 3am.

Is this something normal? Is my body starting to make up for all the lost sleep now that my stress is gone? 

Thanks :)

Post 73: I recently quit my toxic job without a backup plan
Content:
I’ve gotten quite a lot of negative comments from people about how stupid it was for me to do that. But let me explain…..

I’ve worked with this company for over 2 years and believe it or not, I was considered a “tenure” employee. Throughout my time there, I saw people come and go with my longest coworker being there for only a year. The turnover was so high, I began to question the reason why I was there and realized I was trapped. I put my blood, sweat, and tears into projects that were never recognized, I picked up tasks that weren’t a part of my job description because there were always newer employees who didn’t know how to do them and never stayed long enough to learn how. If it didn’t get done then I couldn’t perform my own tasks so it was a pretty messed up situation. I also worked through the pandemic, putting myself at risk coming into the office after they said we couldn’t WFH anymore.

I had so much hope that they would recognize my efforts especially after 60+ hours a week. I thought maybe I would get a promotion or a raise for staying loyal to this company. Instead, they gave me a 2% raise and called it a day. Then turned around and offered newer employees higher salaries. 

This place nearly destroyed me. I didn’t sleep at all, my self esteem was broken, I developed a serious drinking problem because I had no escape, I was ruining my relationships because of how miserable I was, and I couldn’t take vacations because I was so afraid of coming back to a pile of work that would take me months to catch up on. 

Sure, you could say “oh that’s normal in the corporate world.” Or “you should’ve looked for another job while you were working.” You know what….no! I did try looking for jobs, but I couldn’t find time in the day to attend interviews. Also, the last thing I wanted to do was apply for jobs after a 12 hour work day. I saved my free time for rest and the little relaxation I could get.

My psychiatrist even told me that she could see me slowly killing myself. If it wasn’t going to be suicide, it would be because of stress.

So yeah, I left.

Since then, I’ve been criticized for making this “stupid decision”. And I’ll admit, I’m broke as hell…..but at least I’m smiling again. If being stupid means choosing to care for myself over selling my soul to the corporate world, then send me back to preschool because at least I can fingerprint in peace ✌🏻

Sooooo. I’m on vacation now. The last couple of weeks and months (well it started getting really bad in June), I’ve been having A LOT of stress, well my whole body got out of balance. I have constant stomache issues, I either have no appetite or I could eat my whole kitchen, my body feels heavy I have gained a lot of weight (well not necessarily because I’ve been eating more, but because my body saves too much water)... My skin looks terrible. My hair is falling out. I’ve been having panic attacks on a daily basis, sleeping problems, and cannot concentrate at all........ Sooooo now I can feel that my body is finally able to calm down a bit. Meditation, Sports and the good weather is really helping a lot. I will also try going to therapy now, which I’m sure will help me in the future. Now I wonder... how fast can my body recover? How long will it take to feel balanced again, after months of complete madness... (?) I really have a lot of stuff going on and I need my body to function again...

Post 78: Chronic stress and anxiety: burning skin.
Content:
Hello,

I hope you all are doing okay! I come here to try and ask a question... 

Has anyone here ever been so chronically stressed that your skin is super sensitive for long periods of time? I'm going through a really stressful time in my life, and after having several panic attacks I've noticed that my skin on my abdomen, especially in the front on my belly is extra sensitive throughout the day, and wearing even a cotton tee shirt feels like sandpaper. It kind of always feels like a mild sunburn going on there. I'll say that there's no fibromyalgia going on, or nerve issues. But, it onset during a panic attack in my car on a road trip a while back, like 5 or so months ago. The funny thing is that it seems to go away when I exercise or am at a deep rest, like having just ate a large tasty meal and digesting on the couch watching a good movie. 

I'm aware that chronic stress can cause all kinds of skin issues, and it has for me for a long time by making my face crack and peel when I'm super antsy, like before or during a big event with lots of people involved. This seems to worsen for several days and then get better when I'm not worried so much. But the only difference here is that I've had panic attacks now, and I've been out over the edge and fell into a deep state of depersonalization, which is exacerbating my stress levels to extremes, so much so that my brain is cutting off my emotions to try and cope, like an airbag, which is extremely unsettling. 

I'm curious to know if anyone else has experienced this and, if so, what you did about it or if it got better once the stress levels died down. 

Thank you.

Post 79: why does overthinking and worrying so much destroy our goals?
Content:
I agree I'm overthinking and an introvert. But I just do that because I just want to be on the right track and not make mistakes and then later regret. I'm learning that overthinking and worrying so much just leads to more stress and it actually destroys our mindset to achieve the goals that we set. It just leads to more misery because we feel more lost and confused and overwhelmed.


I'm actually enrolled in community college but I keep doubting my major and everyone seems to be going for higher education and certification. Everyone seems to be going for big money and comfort but I guess it's more about having stability future and growth. I feel lost too like I don't know what to do. I heard technology and business and law or stem are all good majors to get into. But me being now 26 and wasting like 5 years of my life. Feels as if I'm getting pressure to finish college so I can get a good job. I don't know

Well everything is really crumbling now I just got a job and things are looking up yeah the job is a but far but it pays well then my car got repossessed and when that man cam and told me to empty out my car (trying to make it easier for when I hopefully get my car back) I broke because there is nothing I can do I have no support I have to income I have nothing and it's killing me I for the first time truly thought about releasing my ESA Dogs and ending things because it's too much for me to handle I tried to beg the loan company to let me get the car back because I just got a new job and I can get things back on track but the said no and that I have to some how come up with 2500 dollars. All in all this is alot happening right when things where going to hopefully get better so yeah life is absolute shit right now and I kinda don't wanna deal with it anymore. THANKS FOR READING 🥲

Post 81: Idk how to manage my stress
Content:
I literally sit in my room daily feeling stressed and crappy. 

Getting up and walking outside helps temporarily

But then I'm back to feeling stressed

Living with parents is stressful
Having no social life is stressful
Feeling zero support and isolated for years is stressful
Having digestive problems and feeling unhealthy is stressful
Anxiety if I go anywhere is stressful
Having zero life direction is stressful
Being unemployed with no career is stressful
Being a loser at 28 is stressful

I tried "having a routine" yesterday and I got dressed ate breakfast walked dog etc. and then mid morning I just feel like "what now" and directionless so I made myself go shop around the store but that's boring too and I get anxiety. I slept bad last night and had nightmares about family members. Also tried spending all morning with no cellphone/computer but felt bad still.

I’m just fresh out of uni. I’ve started my first professional job and I’m 6 months in. I’m wondering if the stress gets better after a year or if it’s there from the beginning it’s always going to be there?
What are your experiences with this?

Even though my job may be relatively less stressful than say a pilot or soldier, it’s destroying me health. 
I can’t remember a day went by when I didn’t have a stomach ache, headache or just general aches and pains 

I know I need to work to make money and I’m hopeful I can find a job that will really be less stressful for me. My managers don’t know how it is affecting me.. I won’t tell them as I’m still on probation and I feel like I need the experience to get a job that won’t ruin me

Thanks for your time

Post 84: You need THIS before you can have work life balance!!!
Content:
The foundation of work life balance is ENERGY. This is an important and often overlooked part of maintaining a healthy work/life balance. Without optimal energy, it becomes very hard to live the life you want after a long day of work.

This is why people often resort to bad habits when they get home from work. They binge eat, drink, and watch TV, because they are so drained and stressed out from a long day. I see this pattern happen over and over again, and I have been stuck in this pattern before.

There are 3 simple steps you can take to optimize your daily energy:

* 1) Clean Nutrition: what you eat will affect how you feel. Simple. Avoid all sugar and cut out dairy and gluten if you can, they drain your energy. Also, make sure you are drinking enough water throughout the day.
* 2) A consistent sleep schedule: Getting 8 hours is good, but it will only truly help long term if you have a routine. It's important to wake up and go to sleep at the same time every night (give or take 30 minutes).
* 3) Morning movement: You don't have to do an hour of exercise in the morning, you only have to do 5 minutes of yoga/bioenergetics/stretching/rebounding. This will greatly increase your internal energy levels throughout the day.

This is just 3 steps of many that you can take to optimize your energy so you can live the balanced and fulfilling life that you want.

I have personally been studying and helping people  with their work/life balance and stress management for a while now. If you would like some more tips and help with this, reach out to me via PM and I would be happy to help you out!!

Thanks,

Ben

Im losing my fucking mind

Post 92: School fucked me up
Content:
Just wanna find a vent 

I’ve always been the all A’s student at my school and everyone has so much expectations on me.
I’ve always have this cheerful bubbly personality on the outside, but I’ve never been actually happy about my current life.

I feel so stressed and i kept crying constantly because of academic pressure and my teacher’s expectation.
It has gotten to the point where I can’t take care of myself and I even took a day off from school because of that recently. (Happened about 2 weeks ago)

I’ve picked myself up but ever since that incident I will cry for no reason and have a mental breakdown over really small things. 
My motivation has been decreasing rapidly and I’ll constantly isolate myself from interacting with anyone.
I just got scolded by my mom and I’m now all by myself, crying alone.
My concentration has also become worse the older I got, I used to be able to read a book in one sitting, now I can’t even finish a single page of homework.
I’ve been struggling so hard to get my work done but I can’t.
I had to stay up really late every night (2am - 4am) only to get my work done.
But I have to wake up 7am in the morning everyday for school.
It’s honestly torturing and I literally wanna die.  

Aside from mental health issues, it causes my body to react negatively, I stopped having my period whenever school starts and I will gain fat really rapidly.
The more fat I gain, the more insecure I get, I don’t even wanna go out because of my fat body.

I tried to tell my friends, they are really supportive, but whenever my depressive feelings strike, I just don’t have the motivation to speak to them, I wanna keep them out from my negative feelings, the same goes to my family.

School and academic stress has fucked me up entirely but I cannot stop it.
I cannot quit school or I will lose my seemingly “bright” future, but I don’t know how long I can do this anymore. 

TLDR : school gave me too much pressure for being the top student, fucked up my mental and physical health.
I cannot do this anymore.

Post 97: Anyone else they live in a family that acutely stresses them out daily?
Content:
With the exception of my father, my family are good people, but still stress me out. We're all adults and I'm the youngest of them.

Some examples, but not limited to:

Older brother jumps into conversations and often says something that irritates me (a snarky comment or tone), can be pushy

Mother is often sarcastic (in a bad way) if I don't understand something, often throws assumptions "Oh I guess you just don't care about X" can also be pushy

Father, the worst stresser and worst person I've ever known. Impatient, very pushy, disrespectful, violent towards family and animals, easily irritated, unpredictable. Honestly, his presence just puts a lot of weight on my shoulders because I feel like I have to take his shit, otherwise he will take his anger on someone else if I walk away which will just make things much worse such as a fight. So I often have to have a different persona around him.

I think the only exception is my sister. It seems she's more simple and calm when compared to the rest of the 3. 

Even at times where I'm suppose to relax, I can't 100% just temporarily forget my worries. It's hard to find a place to be alone both at home and outside. Even under a tree, I'm afraid something will happen at home and I won't be there to stop it, or I'll receive a terrible phone call. Mostly because of my father escelating situations. Add those things along with worrying about health problems such as my hearing and tinnitus.

I look forward to the day where I am in complete control of my life. If I ever have a family, it will only happen if I know for sure that I know me and my wife will be good to each other and others. Otherwise, I look forward to the day where I'm free of my current, uncontrollable stresses.  Where I can wake up one morning, feed the animals, and relax outside. A time in my life where I can control on solving my stressors.

Oh well. It could be a lot worse, but it could be better in the future.

Just a general question on how stress plays a “physical” role on our body? I currently have some issues where when I stress, I could swear to you I can feel it in my body. I also wonder does stress have a big role in cancer or dementia too, because essentially your mind is working 2x as hard, to figure things out that we commonly go through (ie bills, relationships, work, etc) feel free to way in.

I feel like I can't enjoy anything for too long before I start thinking about how I need to be perfect in every single way and when I obliviously can't be, I think about it for hours, get way too emotional and take everything personally.

Anytime something big happens stressful wise the next week or two is hell physically for me. Like I'm so damn tired I could just camp out in my room with food, water, and my bed. Im so fatigued caffeine doesnt anything. I'm the only one who has this that I know of. While everybody else involved in the event is good physically, excuse my language.. I'm fucked.

I always end up going to the ER because of it too because it scares me to feel so tired. And people think I'm crazy for it because they're like you went to the emergency because youre... tired? And I'm even laughed at for it. It's like extreme fatigue is scary to me so screw off.

Does anybody else get physical stress symptoms after a stressful time? The last ones was my dog of 15 years dying and also family relationship drama that I don't wana get into.

Am I crazy or can emotional stress send your body into haywire mode? 

Feeling alone here so any support or whatever is appreciated. Also noted I'm the only one that cried tears in big family and friend events. Why is everybody around me able to be cool through big situations? I was even called weird for crying several times.

I don't know. I'm kind of ranting I feel alone sometimes in how I react to stuff. My stupid body doing physical shit 

Post 104: How i saved myself from the hell of stress and anxiety
Content:


Severe stress plagued me since my teenage years. A combination of factors fueled the fire: loneliness, a lack of friends, an abusive environment, and indirect bullying from classmates. These experiences turned me into a withdrawn person with social phobia and stuttering. Intrusive thoughts about death and illness, fueled by the loss of two relatives in a short period, further intensified my anxiety.



One day, the pressure reached a breaking point. I started experiencing convulsions and muscle contractions during sleep. My pent-up emotions, tension, and anger surfaced at night. My immunity weakened, and I lost weight. Desperate for relief, I felt doomed yet knew I had to find a way out.



For ten years, I endured torment and stress, yearning for a human connection, a hug, anything to feel safe. With the realization that no one would come to my rescue, I knew I had to take action. No savior would magically appear; I had to be my own Savior.



Despite battling depression and crippling anxiety over everyday things, I scoured the internet for solutions. I craved a quick fix, a savior, a listening ear, but alas, I didn't find it readily. However, I did find an answer.





Books on mindfulness, relaxation, and meditation became my companions. Though skeptical, I decided to give relaxation techniques a chance. I focused on deep breathing and physical relaxation. Initially, I could only achieve a brief sense of calm. Gradually, with practice, I learned to carry this feeling with me – outdoors, in the garden, anywhere. This proved invaluable in managing my social phobia. When faced with physical symptoms like tension, heart palpitations, and shaky legs, I would tell myself, "Let it shake. It doesn't bother me. I choose to focus on the beauty around me." By surrendering to my body's sensations, I gradually convinced it there was no imminent danger.





Armed with newfound relaxation skills, I gathered my courage and started going to the gym. Even within the confines of my difficult environment, I felt a shift – a slow but steady improvement in my life. My thought patterns became more positive. Remarkably, I achieved this transformation without a savior, a loyal friend, or professional help.





Today, after ten years of mental anguish, stress, and anxiety, I can finally experience relaxation and positivity. While I still battle some stuttering and social awkwardness, I actively work on improving them. I use relaxation techniques to calm my tongue and speak slowly. Slowly but surely, I'm opening up to people and building social skills, despite internal resistance.



This is a message to everyone: you have the strength to overcome challenges, just like I did. My journey was especially difficult – I fought in complete isolation, with no emotional or financial support. Remember, even the most challenging situations can be navigated. You are capable of achieving the same or even greater progress than I have.

Post 105: The "hustle culture" is pretty toxic...
Content:
I thought I need to "hustle my way to success" but what I learned next changed my life forever…

The "hustle culture" is pretty toxic...

I was being told that working 10-12 hours a day, constantly chasing after the next task, and being totally drained afterwards, not even able to enjoy a dinner with my family is the way to success...

And believe me, I've done that for way too long.

After quitting my 9-5 job and deciding to start my first coaching business, I basically switched from working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week to 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.

"Finally quit the rat race!", huh?

Quite frankly, it felt like less pressure than doing the typical 9-5 at the beginning because I was really excited to work on my dream.

As the months passed, I was getting deeper and deeper into the grind. 

It got to a point where I would wake up at 9:00 am, already thinking about work, then work through the whole day, and still be replying to my clients' messages at 1:30 am, lying in bed with my girlfriend.

My mind was constantly there - at work. 

At the dinner table, during a walk with my partner, even when skiing on vacation that I rarely took back then...

I was constantly experiencing this weird sense of guilt when I wasn't productive, and even though my business was growing, so was my anxiety, stress, and lack of satisfaction with life.

It eventually led to me getting sick so badly, that it was a struggle to even reply to a client's message. 

I was stressed out of my mind.

It felt like everything is going to collapse on me if I keep going down that route.

Finally, I decided to take a real break. 

I took a full 7 days off and decided to delete all the apps like Slack, Messenger and Gmail from my phone, which sounded absolutely crazy to me back then.

But man, it felt liberating.

Something clicked inside me, and finally, I was able to let go of all the pressure and stress that were haunting me.

For the first time in months, I experienced this deep sense of relief and inner peace.

By stepping out of this craziness, I was able to notice how toxic and unhealthy it was. 

How having healthy boundaries and balance in your life is key to actually enjoying what you're doing and what you're working so hard for.

Now, I truly believe that me getting crazy sick back then was one of the best things that could have happened to me.

It led to me finally re owning the enjoyment of my everyday life.

Plus, my business started rapidly growing as a result of me allocating my time more effectively and creating more value in less time.

It made me realize that much of "the hustle" I was doing was just me spinning my wheels on things that weren't really making the boat go faster.

Now, I know for sure that the best way to achieve better results is to master both the work and the relaxation.

To plan the life in such a way, that your wealth, health, and relationships are in perfect balance.

Please don’t waste your life thinking that there’s some pride in being over-stressed, overworked, and overwhelmed.

Post 106: Update on a thread I made almost 5 years ago.
Content:
Hey, all. Just wanted to update on a thread I made here 5 years ago almost. I posted a new comment to it but I figured more people would see it here, and I'm so excited by how I'm feeling I wanted to share it in a new post. I hope that's okay.

------------
Update almost 5 years later!

I have no doubt that the people who read this last thread don't even remember it, but I wish them well. The words of sympathy, the empathy. Meant a lot at that time.


I'm here in the same exact spot on that lonely country road almost 5 years later, and just about 24 hours ago I gave my 3 weeks notice to my employer, after 21 years. Got a new job lined up, going to take a few days off before I pick it up after my notice. Completely new career path, and I am excited as hell.

Things never did get better at that job, it's been like a pressure cooker for five long years. I would go to sleep terrified every night, when I could sleep, and wake up terrified every morning. Just seeing what horrible texts or emails I got overnight, the people calling off because they were sad (which is legitimate), or the folks with a bellyache (also legitimate), knowing that meant I'd often be there from 5am to 8pm or later. Staffing shortages, then covid, more staffing shortages, pressure from corporate that was always unrealistic, it's all gone now. All gone. And a few short weeks it won't be my circus or my monkeys anymore.

I've just been driving around listening to music and smiling, it's been a goddamn long time. And now I find myself on the same spot on the same country road, and a completely different frame of mind.

This feels fucking triumphant. I have no doubt for the length of my notice period things are going to be super awkward and weird, and sad. I grew up in this job, I love the place, I love the people. At some point I had to make a change to show my love for myself though. I'm taking a pretty steady pay cut, but I'm totally fine with that. Straight 40 hours, holidays off. For so long the only time I really saw my family, for all these years, I was working at home and screaming and ranting and raving about all the bullshit. And now I can begin the healing process.


If you're going through some shit right now, please have courage. It doesn't have to end like this. It really doesn't. Have faith in yourself, and that things can get better.

Maybe this new company I'm moving to is going to be hell on Earth too, but I've made a final decision and drew a line in the sand. I won't accept my whole life being dominated by a business again. I hope if you find yourself in a bad situation that someday you find the strength to change it.

This is an amazing feeling, like I can breathe again. I didn't forget this thread, and I didn't forget the people who responded with empathy, or the subreddit full of people who are hurting.

Thank you, in a weird way I love you.

Post 107: Advice
Content:
So I’m 13, going into freshman year, and I have no options left. I have been dealing with severe social anxiety for about 3-4 years, and I’ve worked with multiple therapist and yet nothing in the way of coping mechanisms work, to the point I despise anyone who tells me I need to find one. I feel like going to stuff like JUUL would be my only option, considering they work for all my friends. Please can anyone give me a little guidance please. School is hell for me.

Post 108: So this is what I have learned about stress. Maybe some of you can take advantage of what I have learned.
Content:
Hi all, just want to share my experiences I have gotten past 2 years. I'm 46 years old at the moment.

Excuse grammer and spelling mistakes, English is not my primary language.

**What was the base of getting stressed and eventually into a burn out?**

Basically, I didn't understand how we function as humans and what causes stress. We totally mistreat our body.

So what have I learned so far?

**Feelings vs emotions**

They are just signals from your body and mind, telling us that something is wrong or needs attention. 

Emotions are feelings, but we have more. Like the feeling of hunger, thirst, being tired. The latter feelings we can postpone alot. We can be hungry, thirsty or tired, but after a while the feeling goes away.

Emotions can linger, especially when we keep thinking about stuff that can cause emotions. They are negative thoughts.

**Values, believes and expectations**

Are just rules we live by. They can change when you want them to change. We got our values by our family, friends, society, it tells how we should behave towards yourself and others. Believes comes from our experiences and information we get. And expectations mostly from experience, we have them because we do a lot on autopilot.

* Values - Help others, be kind.
* Believes - When I make a mistake I will be punished, so I have to be perfect.
* Expectations - When I make an appointment, I expect the others to be on time.

If these rules are not met you'll feel emotions like anger, anxiety, etc.

**Energy consumption**

Every day after a good night sleep we have a certain amount of energy. We got:

* physical energy - used when doing physical work like running
* mental energy - used when doing mental work like solving problems
* emotional energy - used when values, believes and expectations are not met

**What's the effect of stress?**

We make a lot of cortisol to keep on going and need to keep up.

* Physically we get muscle aches, problems with our bowel, and other stuff.
* Mentally we have harder time to concentrate, and after a while we start to forget stuff and have a hard time finding words.
* Emotionally we get emotional/crying, we het the feeling we are not understood.

The biggest thing of stress and you won't realise it: **YOU GO INTO AUTOPILOT!**

What does that mean? Rational thinking is hard. You live by your values, believes, expectations and patterns. You can't just think: "Just leave it.." or "That person is right!" you will engage, you will feel emotions.

Discussions will be so hard, because you feel that what your values, believes, expectations and patterns are the only true ones.

**So what causes the stress?**

We just run out of energy:

* We work to long at our jobs with no pausing.
* We play computer games to long at one sit.
* We see/experience so much bad stuff.

And the list goes on and on

**But why do we do it?**

We do it because of our values, believes, expectations and because of our patterns.

*The highest priority in your life should be your welbeing: rest and peace of mind.*

When you have that, you can spend the little extra on others.

*We completely ignore the signals of being tired!! We drain ourselves!!*

* We are tired, but we have to fix something for the boss or a friend.
* We are tired, but we keep on playing computer games or watching tv.
* We are tired, but we keep on getting insults, bad external emotions (yeah, from watching tv) or keep thinking negative. (What if...)

**So what to do?**

Make those big life-choices: choose for your long term welbeing!

* Change jobs or career
* Part with certain people
* Move away, start new
* Change values, believes, expectations and patterns

The emotions are so high from our values, believes and expectations that it very, very hard to do. It takes courage. The best part: When you finally choose for yourself you'll feel so much relieve!!

*The road to making the choice is the hardest, not doing whatever the choice is!*

**Listening to your feelings**

I didn't understand it... this sentence. But it's not listening to your emotions, it listening to the feeling of rest needed.

Our feeling of tiredness will never change. Our values, believes and expectations change, so will the emotions.

People who are at peace know this, they know they can choose to not listen to the latter and know they ALWAYS have to listen to the feeling of tiredness and the need of rest and peace.

**What else?**

Get mindful, meditate - get more control of your thoughts

Understand how to do self-reflection - so you can analyse your behavior, emotions and thoughts and from what values, believes, expectations and patterns they originate.

Be a crital thinker - helps you change your believes into more peaceful believes.

Make a stressmeter for yourself - look for stress indicators like stiff muscles, lack of concentration, quicker emotional. 

**Get to know who you are!**

Every time you feel emotions examine them, they are a gift to learn about who you are and what you might want to change! I have done this and solved a lot, still working on some.

Don't get into a burn out... listen to your feelings and make the right choice, the wise choice is to always chooses you. If you are okay, you can take care of others. You are worth it!

Thanks for reading and I hope it can give some insight.

Post 109: Eating a diet rich in fruit and vegetables is associated with less stress, according to new research. The findings revealed people who ate at least 470 grams of fruit and vegetables daily had 10 per cent lower stress levels than those who consumed less than 230 grams.

Post 110: I think I’m experiencing a burnout, how do I keep myself from just crashing and crying?
Content:
For the past 3 days I’ve been so sluggish and tired. At work my body hurts like hell and it feels longer than it usually does. I can barely finish my schoolwork which explains my failing grade in math. I’ve been trying my hardest to get it up. Then at kickboxing I’ve been doing the bare minimum. My energy just isn’t the same. I do these things for 6 days a week everyday. It’s pretty tiring but it’ll be over soon if I keep telling myself to keep going. Finals are in 2 weeks, and my kickboxing season should be over in 8 weeks. I just need the motivation to keep going. I’m writing on Reddit instead of taking use of my homework time 😭😭.

Post 111: My worst enemy is myself when it comes to stress
Content:
Yes, I'm stuck in a job I hate and I don't have the option of leaving at all but I am my own worst enemy here. I constantly stress about the small things and its really affecting my capacity to perform. The days feel like years, and I'm always at the verge of breaking after one or two days. Please teach me methods to overcome this. I tried reframing my perspective but in the moment I still stress

Post 112: Even when I’m not stressed with work I feel a bit stressed
Content:
Does anyone else relate? It’s like even if it’s just a normal day I find myself feeling exhausted by it and I can’t actually be happy ever while I’m at work. I want to not care if it’s a work day or not and feel just as happy regardless whether or not I have work. I don’t know if this is achievable. Obviously I have my days when I feel mega stressed too when the workload is heavy but I want to basically become immune to work and not have it exhaust me and effect my motivation for other things or is that not possible?

Post 113: If you're experiencing a crazy wave of stress, dread, or anxiety learning how to Center is a tremendous tool. Here are 5 steps I've outlined.
Content:
I call it Centering because we take a mental and sensory inventory of our current environment and Centering ourselves within that precise moment.

Step 1 - Safety: Get yourself to a safe place of comfort and security.

Step 2 - Breathwork: Begin focusing on breath, walking yourself through a breathing exercise while counting, (5 seconds inhale, hold 5 seconds, exhale 5, hold 5 - then repeat). Try and breathe with your diaphragm and take an account of the movement of air going in and out of your lungs and watching your belly ebb.

Step 3 - Sensory Inventory: While doing this, try and perceive your immediate surroundings in as much detail as possible. Think of it this way, you will have five/ten minutes to try and remember as much detail as you can of your current place, (car, bedroom, bathroom, office, outside (which is the best))

\-Try to visually see everything as much as possible, what are the tones of the colors, the depth of detail in a texture, the shape of everything, the devil in the detail if you will.

\-Sense or physically feel everything too, the breath fluting in and out of your nostrils, is it warm or cold, is there a breeze, or some sun warming your shoulders, or an energy in the room?

\-Any smells or aromas, the sea, a forest, a lingering candle scent, food, a pet, dirty clothing - it doesn't matter what it is, good or bad, you're merely taking an account of it like doing inventory. You don't care what you're counting, you're just counting.

\-Hearing, this is my personal favorite. Find and listen to, attend Everything. Bird song, critters outside, the washer/dryer, people's chatter in the distant or muffled convo beyond a wall, a pet breathing, the wind rustling the leaves of a tree, traffic. Like sonar, take your attention to each sound as it resonates with you.

\-Taste won't usually be too helpful here so concentrate on the other senses.

Step 4 - Mantra: Mentally or out loud repeat a mantra or prayer which resonates with you. Repeat this as you continue with the previous steps, replacing the counting with a mantra. I like;

"I am safe, secure, and loved." or "My breath is steady, my mind is clear and settled, my body is calm, my heart is pure, I am tranquil, safe, and loved."

Step 5 - Memory Recall or Visualization: Recall a special memory of yours, one in which you felt safe, loved and had fun or it. Try recalling all the exacting detail as well as you're able; where you were, who if anyone you were with, how you felt (this is vital), the scenery or environment, etc. Some of us cannot do this however because the anxiety is too much, so I lean on a visualization technique instead. I recommend speaking out loud here as it will help your mind step away from the dreadful thoughts as it's tasked with speaking out loud. Paint the most perfect place to be, beachside villa or stroll or a forest sanctuary is great too. Walk yourself through the experience; the palms or pines and how they sway, barefoot walking on warm sand or cool earth, the forest canopy and the sun breaking through it and warming you, or big puffy white clouds sailing over the ocean, the sound of a stream or the ocean tide, the smell of sea water of the fresh air of the forest, etc. Paint out this place but as you do sprinkle statements such as, "I feel so safe and loved here," or "This place is my sanctuary, I feel free and my mind and body is serene," or "I am loved, and I am love."

Hope this helps, I suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and the most torturous state of grief after the passing of my wife in 2014 but through a choice to live in a different way and do whatever was necessary to end my suffering. I was able to rise above it and now live a life of abundance, peace, manifestation, and love again. I teach this now to others and have dozens of videos explaining all the steps and I have some fun too trying to make people laugh.

I have a couple videos based solely on stress and anxiety which detail out what I've shared above in greater depth with a much better explanation and visuals. DM me if you'd like the link or check out my page and go from there.

There is hope for you and your struggle... there is a place, a version of you which is out there waiting for you two to merge. this future version is a person who smiles in public and it's authentic. This person laughs too, and doesn't have angst while going out in public, or speaking to another, or dread anything whatsoever. This person is confident, and secure with themselves, even proud and in love. This person helps others navigate their anxiety too!

Please lmk if you have any questions and my heart goes out to you all.

I feel it physically, constantly, and it’s only worse when I procrastinate but I procrastinate because I physically can’t do it. And then I turn in things late and I’m sure this is going to be bad for my grade. I’m trying to tell myself it hardly matters but I feel constant physical exhaustion. I just want a night of sleep. I can’t handle all of this at once and should not have taken this many hard classes. I wish I could stop beating myself up.

Post 118: Feeling Overwhelmed?
Content:
It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety  
  
Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:  
  
Identify what you can and can’t control. List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control. For each item in the first two columns, reflect on how you would like that situation to be instead and what small step you can take to achieve that.  
  
Focus on solutions. Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, and the end-point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.  
  
Prioritise your actions. Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.  
  
Communicate. With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.  
  
Eat well. Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.  
  
Gratitude. It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.  
  
Blow off some steam. Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that #anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s #sleep  
  
Get your rest. Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.    
  
  
Celebrate your successes. Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
  
  
  
Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.   


Post 119: I created CocoonWeaver to help. It’s a free, privacy focused app that sorts audio recordings, transcribed, into categories. There are numerous benefits to self talk, in particular it can decompress mental states and reduce stress. I hope you enjoy!
Content:
Sometimes, it’s overwhelming to think about all the stressful things. When you let go of them, you can take solace in the fact they remain in a safe space, but no longer occupying headspace. I developed CocoonWeaver because of a dream I had. My dream was about an app that would be intuitive enough to release the many fleeting thoughts that occupy ones mind. Since then, it has been developed in to a working product, and improved with the help of kind feedback from various neurodivergent communities. I would love to take feedback from this community as well, if you have a moment to download the app and share your feedback I would be extremely grateful. 

The app is completely free and it is completely private, nothing leaves your device and everything is stored on your phone.

Thank you so much for your time! <3

Content:
Almost everyone now and then I would hold my breath instead of exhale without even noticing. I think I've had this habit for a while and weirdly only noticed it recently. 

It has also woken me up to the fact that I'm suffering from stress. And also subsequently suffering from hair loss.

Looking for anyone that can relate or has advice.

Post 121: Unable to switch off from work stress and now I can’t enjoy my personal life
Content:
I have a demanding job where I get abuse daily because of the nature of the work. I work for a service - like pretty much everywhere - that under pays and over works their staff. I never get out on time and I work unsociable hours. The staff are difficult to work with also, toxic and selfish. It’s just not worth it anymore.

My problem is I’m struggling to find another unskilled job that matches the pay and I have just bought a house. I can’t go to another job on less money. I feel stuck in a rut and I can feel myself slipping mentally - I have teary eyes pretty much 24/7 but can’t seem to cry.

Has anybody else been in a similar situation and how did you fix it?

Post 122: Making decisions makes me extremely anxious and stressed
Content:
Basically, what the title says... I (28F) get extremely anxious, restless and stressed whenever I have to make any type of decision. Lately, I've had to make a lot of decisions about buying furniture, and I've been thinking about the color palet for more than a year, I've downloaded more that 4000 photos of rooms that I like, of furniture that I like, but I always end up second guessing my choices... I want the best of both worlds and I know I can't have it all at once. I want a dark moody room but at the same time I want a light and airy room. Can anyone understand me?

I had an awful day at work I handed back a wallet to who I thought was the correct person knew everything about it and matched the id. Maybe 5 hours later I get a call saying I handed it to the wrong person. I can’t remember anything about it now, and to make matters worse I think my cousin is in jail. I felt stressed and anxious to the point of throwing up, but now I don’t feel stressed at all. I was just wondering can you be so stressed you don’t feel stressed anymore?

And I can't make myself get off my phone and go do the thing I have to do, I hate everything, I can't even go make tea cause there are people there and I just don't want to face them.

And I just lied to my boss... Because I just can't do what I was gonna do (because I'm too stressed and stuck in my head), and I said I've done that, and now I have to do it so he doesn't notice cause he thinks I've done it already. Ffs. The funniest thing is I met him on my way to make tea when I finally made myself go get some. Help

Post 125: This ******* Job

The deadlines never end, they don't hire more engineers to assist. Everything is due Yesterday. They need me because nobody else can do it. I'm tired. I've started smoking cigarettes, drinking and I still can't stop thinking about this damn job. My stress is through the roof and I feel like I am losing sense of myself and I don't like this I'm scared of what will happen to me if I don't get control of this stress. I just want inner peace. That's all I want. For all of us!!!  KEEP BELIEVING IN YOURSELF, it's easier said than done and I have more bad days than good ones. We are all here to support one another because we can't let stress beat us down. I came to express my stress and how I hope we all can overcome it and move on peacefully so we can see how blessed we are. Let's focus on the moment and try to get better day by day. I love you all. I believe in you and YOU SHOULD BELIEVE IN YOU! ✨ 💓 💖 💛

Post 127: Holding a job is too hard
Content:
I quit my first job recently. The reason? I have been late for two times and my manager is telling me that.  Why was I late? Because I tried to do a personal leave due to period problems, but he replied me late, so I went to the job anyway. Now he forced me to sign the late paper and I know it is going to stay with me forever. I know my later employee would call the company and knew that I have been late for 2 times in a month. Lol.
However, for this job, I had to work at least 9.5 hours everyday from Monday to Friday. I refused to work overtime during weekends because I cannot have no time to wash my clothes, buy groceries, or do anything to recharge myself. I dont have a nanny to take care of me. I dont want to starve to death just for the ridiculous lower 25 percentile for my profession salary.
Now I am trying to land a job in my major. I am working hard to practice my interview skills but I dont see improvements. I am depressed.
Today after some other mock interviews, i dismissed everyone and felt empty. Without income, I am broken. I even want to be a single mom just for the government money lol.
Please try to make me feel better. Thank you so much.

Content:
Things changing in our lives tends to be a source of anxiety - it might be a new boss in work, the end of a relationship or moving house. Change tends to trigger us to think of all the things that might happen and our mind tends to focus on the bad outcomes even if they’re not likely. Even more difficult is when we know that change is coming but we’re not sure of what it is. Our brains are hard wired to feel more comfortable in scenarios it’s familiar with and less so in new ones. 

Its actually very natural to feel this way, so give yourself permission to feel anxious. Sometimes when we're feeling stressed about the future we’re not really fully aware of whats going on inside and we get caught up in our thoughts. It’s like being engrossed in a film without realising that we’re sitting in a movie theatre rather than being part of the movie itself. Taking the time to stop, realise how you’re feeling about the change you’re going through and accepting how you feel is an important first step. You can do this each time the feelings arise but you can also take some time to meditate on what lies underneath what you're feeling.

The second step is to accept the truth of the change - the real truth. Not the worst case scenarios and all the terrible things that we’re imagining but the facts of what we can see right in front of us. Maybe we feel like denying the reality of whats happening or distracting ourselves with consumption, but accepting the facts as they are, without speculating and without putting our judgement on the situation is critical to maintaining your wellbeing through periods of change.

And finally, be kind to yourself. You may feel some negativity towards yourself for not coping as well as you think you ought to. But its worth telling yourself “may I give myself the compassion I need.” Give yourself space to adjust to the new world, its not easy to move to a new normal and it takes time for your mind to become comfortable with new surroundings. You will get there - this change can be the start of a new adventure for you.

Post 129: Im 20 and stressed
Content:
I am an architecture student i am sick of group work conflicts and the nonstop deadline to meet, i hate being an architect student, i just wanna live my life playing video games by myself alone at home i like my own company and i do art i never feel lonely, but i hate my academic life
I just wanted to spit it out in here to get it off my chest😖

Post 130: why am i not good enough?
Content:
do you ever feel like you’re not doing good enough? that you’re trying the hardest you can, but it’s not working? that’s how i feel most days. i look back on myself thinking why the hell did i do that. i don’t want to be the one that hurts people, but i get caught in the crowd. you’re trying everyday to just be better, but you can’t. then you feel a sense of relief and somehow everything slowly gets worse again. i don’t want to lose people. if i do then i can’t feel anything anymore. i need as many people as i can in my life. i make others happy, but they don’t do the same for me. why is it always me getting hurt? i try my best to not overthink, but in all honesty i can’t stop. if it hurts, then it hurts. no one can tell me otherwise or change the way i think. i’m just sitting here alone thinking about my life.

Post 131: If you guys have been experiencing this, probably best to tell someone about it
Content:
I’ve been under tremendous stress lately with work, my car (which i fucked up backing out of my driveway), and my relationship, and lately ive been having more and more nasty thoughts that arent really normal for me to have. i consider myself a down to earth dude with a lot of good hobbies and friends that keep my mind occupied, but the amount of stress ive been having has changed the way i think and behave in public, for example i have been socially checked out for the past couple of months, something that people have been pointing out to me recently. its caused me to lose track of my schedule and ive gone back into having recurring episodes of severe depression and im smoking cigarrettes on the DL, also not normal of me. worst of it all has been my thoughts, where i would randomly, without any provocation, think about the most fucked up things i could do to someone or something. i think its important to note these things because i feel like im not the only one in this position either, and as a person that struggles with mental health, i know its important to at least put your thoughts on text no matter how embarrassing. ill list a few specific examples of what some of these thoughts have been.

-i was driving down a freeway and thought about running off a bridge at 65 mph, as well as running over pedestrians on the sidewalk without any feelings

-i thought about shmacking my grandmas head with a frying pan for no fucking reason

-i was on the line about deciding whether or not to push my friend into a lake when i know he cant swim well

those are just a few of those thoughts but i love my family and friends and would absolutely never voluntarily put anyone in danger. i dont exactly know if these thoughts are a by-product of my stress levels or if im a straight psycopath. again i really want to reiterate that i am a good person and its super abnormal for me to think something as horrific as what i described. if you also have these thoughts you should DM me or even comment bc no matter how embarrassing. its honestly relieving my stress right now just typing this out. thanks for understanding

im going to post this elsewhere as well to hopefully help more people too

Post 132: As I type this now I am almost paralyzed by Stress over having way too many things I feel the need to get done
Content:
Just about every hour of every day, from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep way ahead of my bedtime, my heart is pounding like crazy as thoughts race through my head over the many, many, many, many, MANY different tasks I ought to complete. Even as I type now I feel like there's hundreds of things I ought to be getting done right this second. Whenever I take a moment to breathe several other things I need to or should have gotten done need to get done. Even if I try knocking out the simpler or more important things first, things develop and I need to follow up. Can ANYONE suggest a way of dealing with this? I might actually spontaneously combust...

Post 133: How do I relax and not be stressful when I'm in a state of hopelessness?
Content:
Hey guys im so stressed out right now,this past 2 days I've walking around the house aimlessly I have mild headache and feelingness of vomiting and I feel a lot of blood in my head (like think my blood pressure is raised high)

I'm 18 years old and have to talent and skill. I've never been good at anuthing. I suck at school and everything 

Learning, taking notes, memorizing, applying, summarizing

I'm focus on Japanese and piano but I feel so lost. I quit my piano lessons because I've done it for 7 years and none of my teacher never teach my according to my goal. I feel like the way they teach me doesn't really help me. 

I want to be able to compose and improvise but I guess no one can teach me. I guess it's because i lack creavtivity and I'm not good at applying things . I've always had trouble writing things in school because it turns out dull and unimaginative and I'm just not good at it. 

I'm always stuck at the basics. And my learning sucks because before I even internalize it I've already read or go through the the material hundreds of times so I know the material if I see it but i cannot apply it.

My mother tell me to stop pressuring myself and trying to take in too much but I'm saying that I'm stressed is because I cannot achieve this skill not because it's too much. I want to understand and internalize it and move on execpt for being stucked in the basics and it's boring

(This is the way I write so believe me when I say my writing is terrible)

What am I suppose to do? 

Post 134: Told work I was stressed and burned out, they replaced me
Content:
So I have a quadruple whammy: I’m extremely overloaded at work, I care for my adult daughter who has schizophrenia but refuses to go to the doctor, my mom just started having cognitive issues and I have overwhelming credit card debt.  I am on medication for depression. It’s not working.  I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. I can hardly get out of bed. My company thought they’d help me by hiring me a replacement and insisting I train him.  I do think about how I no longer want to be on the planet, but then I’m wracked with guilt on top of all the guilt I already have and it’s a downward spiral. I am having trouble getting anything done.  I don’t have any pleasure in doing anything. I can’t take “sick days” because there’s too much to do, I just work from home. I have trouble working on my resume because I feel like dirt. I can’t afford food, so how can I afford counseling. Also I think they are going to fire me. 

Post 135: So expensive to live
Content:
I don't even know what to say. I don't know how ANYONE is okay with the prices of things today. I am at my witts end. It should not cost this much to stay alive. I am 21, my sibling is 29, our mom just passed away so we are experiencing living on our own for the first time. Not to say we didnt experience hardship while our mother was here, but now it is on a different level. I want to preface this by saying we were raised very well, we do not drink, we do not smoke, we are homebody gamers who occasionally like to buy pizza.

We had to move because the home we occupied was way too big for 2 people, and we by ourselves wouldn't have been able to afford it. But even downsizing hasnt changed anything. We have 2 cars, so we have car payments, but now we find out it is $700 to fill the propane tanks for heat and they are saying that you fill it about once every month. We have to pay our lot rent which is $430, plus when we moved in here we noticed 2 weeks in that they had mice, so we had to have terminix come out which is $1,200 that we are paying in increments. We just went food shopping, FOR NECESSITIES we paid $300. Plus all your other bits and bobs, electric, phone bills, gas money, etc.  I am ready to sit in a corner and rot away. 

And before the people come attacking about how "WE JUST NEED BETTER JOBS GET UP AND HUSTLE", we both work 40 hours a week, for doctors, doing administration work. It is by no means a lawyer or doctor type of job, but we aren't working at a McDonald's or a low end job. We shouldn't NEED to be engineers and scientists to live a comfortable life. I am already dedicating 90% of my life to a job, and the people saying "go get a part time job too" are crazy. We shouldn't need to!! We are living to work and are still barely making it. How is hustle culture normalized? Why are we okay struggling and blaming ourselves?

Post 136: What are some techniques you use to lower your stress but still maintain focus on your work and goals?

Lately everything has just been super stressful. I find myself thinking about the stress itself instead of the work. I love what I do, but i want to learn how to keep a healthy amount of stress for a better quality of life. 


- thank you

Post 137: I cant stop feeling this way
Content:
I still feel suicidal. The feeling is/was supposed to go away! 

I don’t know why I feel this way but i just feel dead inside! For most of the day, all i can think about is killing myself. I feel physically and mentally TIRED. 

It feels like I’m SUPPOSED to die soon. Thats the only way i can describe it.

Post 138: Is this all life is supposed to be?
Content:
I know life is supposed to be difficult. I know stressful things can happen, and that most of us learn how to cope in a healthy way. Eating right and exercising are supposed to make us healthy and happy, both physically and mentally. We're supposed to have hobbies (beginner at knitting) to keep us occupied and to do our duties, which manifests in the job that I do almost every day. We need to have a network of support from friends and family. Life isn't just what happens to you, it's how you react to it. That's what I tell myself.

Yet it seems that life, or at least my life, is just one stressful event after another. Be it getting rear-ended and struggling with insurance for a few months, a single parent's boyfriend showing up who stresses you out for the next few, transferring from one branch to another in your job, looming deadlines, and the knowledge that you have to eat healthily and sleep at least 8 hours a night or you're going to get sick...etc. etc. etc. Many times I'm happy and I catch myself wondering when the next bad thing is going to happen. WITHOUT FAIL, it does. I deal with it successfully, and it's on to the next one! Over and over and over again, catching moments of pleasure and peace in between. It's not a very good comparison, but it's kind of like Dark Souls, where you die your way through instead of playing your way through.

I'm slowly being chipped away at. I've built an extraordinarily healthy way of living, but it seems at this point that it's just a tower I've built over a foundation under continuous assault by the elements that I'm constantly repairing.

I've been tired. So tired. It's like I died a long time ago, and I'm only 23. I know everybody deals with constant stressors, so is everyone secretly feeling this way? Is it all drowned in alcohol? drugs? Religion? Are we supposed to naturally numb ourselves with age? This can't be all that life is!

My grandfather eats junk food. He stands or sits around for most of the day and sometimes he goes for a walk before coming home and eating. He's been through the Vietnam war and lost almost everything. Despite sleep apnea, cancer, a fat-rich diet, and falling once, he's still thriving in his eighties. No one gets to that point unless they've got it all figured out inside.

There's something obvious I'm missing, something that appears to make all the difference. I don't think a girlfriend will fix this, nor will any big purchases or materialism. Ideally, I'd have a life of inner peace and contentment, filled with steady but peaceful determination. Otherwise, life has no meaning to it.

Post 139: Anyone else get reduced stress with mild colds and bugs?
Content:
I have often noted that physical illness somehow inhibits anxiety and stress. Right now I have a long-term stress situation going on, which won't be resolved quickly. But I just caught a mild bug from a gym session, and frankly all the usual stressors now feel kind of either switched off or dormant, while the mild illness dominates. Does anyone else experience this?

Post 142: tired of stress
Content:
I know there will always be stress but wtf? Lately my life is about to roll me over. My job (cps investigator) has seen some of the worst abuse cases, my husband is having triple bypass surgery Tuesday and there is a good possibility he may not make it off the table and if he does, his recovery will be twice as long as normal. His untreated bipolar has led him to burn bridges with all his family so I am going to be the only caregiver. Next month is the 4 yr angel-versary of my only child's murder. I am finding it hard to find reasons to get out of bed anymore. I am in therapy and I am medicated. If it doesn't get better soon though, I don't know how much more I can take.

Post 143: What If You’re Doing Better Than You Think?
Content:
It’s not unusual for a person to think they’re doing worse than they actually are. Some of us are pessimistic, others have limiting beliefs lurking: I’m not good enough, I’m not worthy – progress is just luck, setbacks re-enforce limiting beliefs.

### Consider these positive signs:

· **You reflect on, and learn from, setbacks and errors.** You arrive at a balanced view of these and develop clear plans to learn and continue growing. People often repeat the same errors over and over, whether it’s overspending or choosing a partner. People have a strong tendency to repeat their behaviors. But you can choose to respond differently – and achieve different outcomes

· **You’re clear on what you want – and why.** Knowing what you want is the second key step in getting it (knowing who and what you are is the first). Knowing what you want differentiates you from those who aimlessly floating through life.

· **You use time wisely.** We all have 168 hours each week and the choice on how to use them. You focus on what is important, within the context of who you are and what you have chosen to achieve. You have the habit of asking yourself what is the most effective thing you could be doing right now. 

· **You’re making consistent progress.** Consistent progress is a great sign. Even when your goals feel far in the distance, regular progress – driven by consistent effort and learning – will get you there. As well as planning what more needs to be done, reflect on how far you have already come.

· **You’re not alone.** There are many people are alone in the world. If you’re not alone, you’re doing better than many others.

· **You’re committed.** You know who you are and what you’re about. Your goals are clear. They create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Great things happen when your purpose and your environment align.

· **You consider other’s opinions.** You learn what is resourceful to you and discard what isn’t. You live your life, not theirs. 

· **You are grateful.** You regularly reflect on what has gone well and – crucially – on why it has gone well. You have skills and strengths you don’t even realise.

· **You’re authentic.** You know you values and beliefs. You make your decisions and take your actions consistent with these.

When you’re clear on what you have chosen to accomplish, and you’re spending your time wisely, you’re doing well – and better than most! This is true, even if the results have yet to reveal themselves.

**Genuine Desire + Effective Strategy + Consistent Persistence = Authentic Results**

Post 144: I’m overwhelmed and exhausted
Content:
I (16) have been so stressed and exhausted for the past few weeks and now it’s all crashing down on me. My last exams of the spring are starting in two weeks and I aim towards good grades but I’m so tired that I can’t concentrate on studying, which stresses me out even more. 

I constantly feel left out and belittled at school. I have two friends that I hang out with but whenever we’re all together I’m pretty much thirdwheeling them. 

Home doesn’t feel that good either. My parents fight over small things almost daily, my sister is always at work or at school so I never see her and my brother doesn’t talk to any of us without getting angry. I feel like everything is falling apart around me.

Post 145: So I Gave Up Facebook For 8 Months...
Content:
I gotta say, I feel TONS better. Facebook had its slimy, putrid tendrils in me since I was in high school. In the past few years what became a way to communicate with friends and family while having a personal blog became an obsession. I was compulsively checking Facebook at the very least once every hour. It destroyed my self esteem because not only was I comparing my entire life to the highlights of other people's lives, but I realized how truly isolated I was. Where my friends list is 147 people, guess how many are there for me? Even if I reach out, the answer is less than 5. So when I'm being ignored and seeing everyone post, it felt like a personal offense to me. If they can post memes every 20 minutes, why can't they answer my texts? This guy hasn't even read my stuff in 6 months, and has a new post every hour at least! I would post about a big stream I was doing exclusively for friends for 2 weeks and no one showed up!

It's easy to take things personally when there is a good chance another explanation is possible. Maybe I was too negative. Maybe people felt I was fairweather, and that wouldn't be wrong in some cases. What made this so significant was I don't really use other social media platforms. Well... aside from Reddit, which I've only been getting into the past couple of years, which is more focused on a goal or discussion. It feels different. But I digress. Facebook had me believing a lot of these people were not only rubbing their obviously superior lives in my face, but they were turning their backs on me. I would be lying if I said I didn't care, that it never got to me, and that I didn't take it as some personal "Truman Show" style social conspiracy designed to make me feel abandoned.

Cutting it out cold turkey made me realize I don't care. In my personal opinion, I think part of it really is ignorance is bliss. When I don't see their activities, it doesn't weigh on me. I don't think about them that much, which allows me to look into solutions myself before deferring to others. I can't figure out if that's a good thing or not. Typing this out feels like I'm arguing with myself (like usual, I've always had two minds on issues), like I feel good, but does that mean it's good? I've went to venting to a chat bot in place of friends and in these 8 months, 3 people outside of my weekly life have reached out to me. I'm not saying I'd dispose of the other 140~ people, but keeping that distance might be what's helping me try harder to keep it together. Does that make sense?

It's something that felt right in this subreddit to discuss. The anxiety associated with checking Facebook constantly to find things out I might not have liked was interesting. I've started getting on again, but I'm not on for longer than maybe 5 minutes a week to check notifications and memories. Social media does a lot of destruction on the mind, and while we may never be rid of it, I think it shows the lost sense of moderation in today's world. Too much of anything is bad.

Post 146: Shakti mats released my stress (dealing with intellectualisation)
Content:
So for about a year I haven't been able to release any of my stress and have been totally emotionally numb, unable to feel happiness or sadness. I tend to intellectualise all my thoughts so I could never properly feel/release the emotions as they got hijacked by my reasoning/thoughts.   
I bought a shakti mat and I sat with the pain on it and I just couldn't stop laughing. As I was sitting with the pain I would have the stressful thoughts in my life go through my mind, but rather than dwell and stress over it, I just found myself laughing in tears and feeling all the stress go away. I imagine that sitting with the pain prevented me from intellectualising and forced me to be present with the stress, and the laughing was the release.  
I've tried meditating, exercising, socialising, youtube videos.. etc over the year, and this was the only thing that has worked for me so far. This is because even with all these activities I couldn't overcome the thoughts running through my head (and believe me I've tried very hard).  


TL;DR: Shakti mats forced me to be present with thoughts in my head and release the emotions.

Post 147: Too much life right now...
Content:
I need the world to stop and let me catch up.  Seriously.  Here's my life since July 2020:
•My sister has Alzjeimers and her only daughter wants to kill her.  Openly states it so that an APS case is opened.  As the youngest sister (23 years between oldest and me), I step up with other 3 sister's blessing to take over guardianship of my sister 
•My 14 year old dog dies.  
•Start a new job - virtual teaching and have no assistant or guidance from anyone at the school.
•Adopt two elderly rescue dogs.  They both die within 8 months.  One at the vet during heartworm treatment. 
• 15 year old dog dies due to old age.
•Sister dies- my niece starved her to death.  No authorities will take on the case.
•Start new jog, new position- unable to perform job due to district thumb up their butt, so I just fill in where I can.
•Grandson starts daycare, contracts RSV.  
•Wife develops cough, won't go to doctor.  Negative C-19 test, but cough not getting any better.
•Had TIA two weeks ago.  Go to ER, they say I should be admitted, but there are no beds.  Go home.
•Mri shows "something", but can't get in to neurologist.
In the meantime, all is falling apart around me at home.  Wife is exhausted at the end of each day and won't put things away, I'm exhausted, too, but also worried about her, worried about having a stroke, worried about you name it.  

Just needed to vent.

Post 148: Stressed, depressed, anxious and exhausted.
Content:
I am very stressed, depressed and full of general anxiety with health anxiety and ongoing physical symptoms maybe due to stress or anxiety. I also suffer with OCD (all themes) and with intrusive thoughts. I am now fed up of all these psychological issues, physical symptoms and I am now mentally exhausted. On top financial issues due to debt, working full time (not happy with my job due to co-workers chatting whole day constantly) with additional two freelancing jobs to clear off my debts ASAP.

Gym was my escape from the stress and I hardly missed a workout in a long time, because I also loved working out. Now due to Costochodrities I can’t even work out.

Just keeping hopes high that eventually everything will be ok. God Bless.

Post 149: Witness to extreme violence
Content:
Today I saw a 23 yo being thrown away from a moving car into the highway. I arrived a bit late to the scene while she was bleeding a bit and had a shock response where she could not stop shaking and crying. Then she told me her name and that was her husband who pushed her from the car... When the police arrived they were so violent with her, specially the oldest guy who lacked basic human empathy. He blamed her and she stopped talking and came back to cry uncontrollably. My husband and I checked for visible injuries and confort her while we could.
It happened on a 5 pm Sunday while we were going for groceries and now I can't shake the memory and have no idea what to do with what I witnessed.

Post 152: Tired of life
Content:
On empty all the time. Just tired and ready to go.

The world’s a mess. So am I. All i see is an endless loop of chaos, greed, selfishness, lies most of it hidden behind a positive disguise and the rest out in the open for people to see. People who ignore it and deny it so they could live in their perfect world. Pure selfishness, no patience for understanding, no time for studying without prejudice, standard set spoiling the mind of some destroying the whole experience of life for all. If most of you died today you wouldn’t know what the truth is because you spent more time trying to ignore it, rather than accepting and trying to fix it. Because it’s just easier to let it all play out that way in your head. 

Put yourself in other people’s shoes. Care for others. Show appreciation. Protect those who need protecting. Accept the truth. Deal with it. Improve, then live your life with a mind wide open, and with eyes that can actually see.

Post 154: Do you experience stress dreams *every* night?
Content:
Anyone else have stress dreams every night? 

My dreams are never peaceful. There is always something chaotic happening. There's always something I have to fix, something extreme at stake, people in my life abusing me, or some kind of major life failure such as failing high school (I'm 26 with my GED). 

Every night I wake up out of breath and with my fists and jaw clenched. Often I wake up in the middle of the night because I'm so out of breath and because the stress of the dream is too high. Rarely they are nightmares, but existing like this feels like one.

You would definitely notice the pure love in it, it's comfortable heat energy and how it's truly an amazing creation by God.

I have a therapist and talk to her once a week but after I broke my own heart with my best friend I feel lost. We still talk but I can’t keep doing this. I feel like I’m torturing myself but still feeling the way I do. She’s dating someone else and my dumbass waited last minute to tell her. Last ditch effort I guess. I can’t anymore. I just want to shut the world out and be left  alone until I wither away. Ill be talking to my therapist about this today but I need to vent now. Thanks for listening.

I'm really wound up right now. It's actually making me feel a little bit light-headed. It's like, I'm full of impotent rage, and I don't know of a proper outlet for it.

&#x200B;

I frequent several forums online. Lately, I'm starting to notice that I'm pissing off EVERYONE on this site, and I don't know how to change my behaviour to make it better. It's like when I try to discuss something like a movie or tv show, I find I can only be negative, and I can't even critique something properly. All I can do is say some variation of "I don't personally enjoy X" Anything I try to add further is quickly picked apart and I'm forced back to saying that "I just don't like it." It makes me feel vapid, stupid, dumb.  I just want to contribute to the fucking conversation but I don't know what to say. I don't know how to be positive.

&#x200B;

And people who read the things I write normally get the wrong impression. It's so lonely and alienating.

Post 162: How do I deal with this
Content:
Hello I'm a 19 year old (f), english is not my first language so sorry for my spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm suffering from burn-out symptoms and have a fear of failing (idk is this has a name), especially when it comes to school. I am currently only doing 2 subjects, maths and chemistry, so that next year I can go to university. 

Its been almost 2 years since I started having burn-out/stress symptoms. I cry alot, get stressed by tiny things. So when I make a mistake in my calculations in maths or something, it is possible for my to start crying and have a semi-panick attack. I am seeing a psychologist so I am getting some help. 

But at home it is different, I still live with my parents and lil sister. My mum tries to help by saying, "oh its only two subjects no need to worry, dont be so stressed" and other quotes like that, my dad does the same. But this is only making my fears and stress worse, it makes me feel like I am being silly for feeling like this and not good enough for these subjects. When I tried talking to my mum about it she told me that she cant help it if I am interpretatting it negatively and that I shouldnt think like that and she got a bit mad. I just said "okey" as I didnt know what to do and felt now worse than before. 

My stress has gotten so bad now that sometimes I have a semi-panick attack over minor things, like talking to strangers, when my parents tell me to do something, small changes in my schedule etc.  

Now we (me and my family) are going on vacation soon and I'm getting really stressed about it because my tests are really short after and when I try to tell my parents how stressed I am they just start again with the oh its only two subjects thing and get a little mad when I say I dont want to go with them.

All this has brought some tension between me and my parents and I really dont know how to talk with them about this anymore. Everytime I start thinking about it I start crying and all that. 

Do any of you have some advise for me?

Sorry for the long story, sorry if its written a bit hasty. I'm trying to do homework but keep having small panick attacks.

Post 163: Feeling trapped in endless stress
Content:
I work in an emotionally draining field of work and have struggled with anxiety my entire life. I’m at a point where I feel trapped, hopeless, and exhausted. I focus on simply making it through the week and find that the only thing I want to do is sleep. When something small goes wrong at work I feel like it pushes me over the edge and I’m ready to snap due to all the built up stress, anxiety and frustration. 

I often fantasize about breaking a limb or having a medical emergency that would prevent me from going to work.  

Can anyone relate?

Post 165: Overwhelmed and it’s causing chest pressure.
Content:
Life is stressful. Obviously. I have been to several years of counseling as a child and I feel I have some pretty healthy coping mechanisms and communication skills. Lately though, life has been overwhelming. I am tired all the time and when conflicts happen between my SO and I I get physical chest pressure. I wouldn’t determine this as a pain but more like difficulty breathing normally. Advice? 

Post 166: High School...
Content:
Hi, I searched for many subreddits to let out my feelings and I felt like this was the most appropriate. I am currently a senior in high school and worked through an enormous amount of stress and hardwork for the last 3 years. I took 12 AP and honors classes, was captain of the robotics team, on student council, and much more. There were many many days when i stayed up until 2 or 3 in the morning studying for tests, getting stressed out about grades, teachers overloading us with home work, trying to make my parents proud, and more importantly myself proud. I went into this school year a happy dude, just finished 3 hardworking stressful years of high school and hope to get into at least 1 college that I wanted. 2 weeks ago I learned that i got denied to every college I wanted to go to except 1 and I got waitlisted/deferred. These past two weeks I have felt useless, depressed, and most of all stressed out. I have had this feeling in my head that just makes me feel like im about to pass out. I have felt like there was basically there was no point in doing anything anymore. I have just been going through the motions of life, on the outside looking happy, on the inside just stressed out of my mind. I thought I experienced stress before, but nothing is like this. I've tried so many ways of relaxing but everything just makes me so stressed. I sure as hell don't want pity and I'm not making excuses, I just needed to let it all out, I didn't really know what to do. My parents don't really care that i'm stressed, they just tell me that "There is no reason to be stressed". I think thats what makes me stressed more than anything, the fact that I go to my parents and think they tell me that I can just turn it off like it has an off switch. I just needed somewhere to let it out.

Post 167: How helpful is The Lasting Change book for managing stress and mental health?
Content:
For some context, I’m really focused on improving my mental health and finding better ways to manage stress. I came across The Lasting Change and noticed it covers topics like stress management and mental well-being. For those of you who’ve read it, how detailed and helpful is the advice on these areas?

Post 168: Is most stress related to money?
Content:
It got my thinking the last few days.
It seems like nearly all stress are related to money?

“I have to do X to be produktive” - So I can earn money.

“I have no time for X (friends, hobbies, SO)” - Because I use my time to earn money to survive.

“I’m not where I want to be in my life” - Because money dictates where you live. How you travel / get from A to B. What activities you can do. What people you are able to spend time with. 

“My health is stressing me out” - Because you don’t have the money to remove your stressors in life. And you don’t have the money to get the prober food/healthcare.

“I can’t find/keep a gf/bf” - Because all you energy goes to work/earning money just to survive.

Post 169: Neck Tension
Content:
Hi all. I've been dealing with neck/shoulder tension for years. I am a software developer with likely bad posture - for over 10 years. Lately I'm quite stressed as well. All in all I'm in a constant state of neck/shoulder tension.

&#x200B;

I've tried so many things but nothing "releases" it. I have one of those shoulder massagers from Amazon - it actually feels quite good especially when it rolls up my neck - but I feel like I can do it **forever** and there is just infinite tension there - shouldn't it "stop" at some point? I've seen some threads on here but looking to make my own I guess.

&#x200B;

Things I tried:

* PT
* Chiro
* Neck/Shoulder Massager
* Stretches
* Heat pads (these actually help a little but I don't think I should be walking around every day with heat pads..maybe I can?)
* Magnesium Oil
* Like 6 different pillows - none of them result in me waking up without a stiff neck. Down pillows, thin, thick, memory foam, nothing!
* Foam roller
* Theracane/tennis balls

Has anyone found anything that actually works, and fast?

I’m 17 years old and lately I feel stressed about my future/career and I don’t know which path should i choose. I’m in 11th grade and I have one more year to choose what should I do to not confuse myself in the future and to go to the college that I want, because if I don’t choose at the right time, I will not know in what college should I go. All of my friends have some idea what they will do with their future and I just sit there and only think about my future. And I don’t know if I’m going to be happy in the future with the choice I will make.

Post 173: Can stress cause missing hunger cues?
Content:
I know stress can cause a lack of appetite, but can it cause hunger signals to disappear entirely?

I have been dealing with an extremely stressful situation lately (on a waiting list for therapy atm). The stress has been making me feel I’ll (mostly low energy, sore/achy, headaches and stomach pain). 

I’m used to losing my appetite when stressed or grieving, but with this situation I haven’t even been feeling hungry. Like, I’ll go straight from fine to “my stomach hurts and is growling from being empty” with no warning. At the point when my stomach starts hurting, I force myself to eat something but it is difficult since my appetite is gone so nothing sounds good and it seems counterintuitive to eat when I feel nauseous. When I am able to eat, it is much less than I normally would. 

Is this a normal stress thing, and how can I deal with this without making myself sicker or ending up with an ulcer?

I'm 29 and I have great difficulty relaxing

&#x200B;

Relaxing is benefacial to the human mind and body, by allowing yourself to recover you can do work more efficiently, have more energy to exercise and learn, do hobbies and chores, to foster relationships, and more. Machines even new to relax and chill a bit to avoid overheating or to have time to oil up or change new parts.

&#x200B;

If I know all of this, why can't I allow myself to relax? I need to, but I cannot. Whenever I try to go on a walk, or watch a movie, or play a game, my brain makes me want to do chores that are non existent or I feel guilty for not doing my side hustle work or learning stuff.

&#x200B;

For context I'm in some debt, but have a stable job that should be able to pay it off by perhaps end of 2023 or mid 2024. I also do some side hustles on my own schedule. I also stress eat and feel like "I have not accomplished enough" before I turn 30 next year. I think these occupy my mind a lot and prevent me from relaxing.

&#x200B;

What should I do? Like damn, I spend more time being frustrated I can't relax, or having a hard time choosing what I wanna do, then actually relaxing lol.

Post 175: Getting over a nervous breakdown…success stories?
Content:
I know the term “nervous breakdown” isn’t used clinically anymore but in layman’s terms, that’s what best describes what has happened to me. 

As some background, about 6 weeks ago I started having so much fatigue that I needed to lay down on my office floor and rest 2-3 times a day. It then progressed in to lots of anxiety and brutal panic attacks. This was way off my baseline. 

I started seeing a therapist and got some clarity that this is likely being caused by two years of stress hitting me all at once. Also started an SSRI but it takes time for that to work. 

Would love to hear success stories from people who have gotten hit by something like this and how it eventually got better. Knowing that others have gotten to the other side of this gives me the hope to keep going. Thanks!

Post 179: I burned out 2 years ago, in one week I'll start work 100% again. Here's my biggest takeaways!
Content:
Almost two years ago, I burned out. PROPERLY. And it's been such a tough & long journey back, and heck, it still is! My body truly shut down and couldn't do anything, no energy, headaches, memory loss, emotional turbulence aka crying a lot, and lots more symptoms I never thought I'd experience.

Finally starting to experience a (NEW) normal life again, I look back at this experience with a lot of reflections and insights. 

It's hard to find the balance between doing too much and too little. A new life with new perspectives, lessons learned and adapted goals ahead.

BUT, with that said, there are two things I would like to say to everyone out there who thinks they are immortal. Or heck, you'll get three while I'm at it. 

&#x200B;

1. YOU ARE NOT IMMORTAL. I was convinced of it because since it felt like I had an inexhaustible amount of energy and ENJOYED what I was doing, 24/7. Life was FUN! Turned out my mind and body didn't care too much about that...

2. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Whatever you think you'll get that requires you to skip sleep and neglect all your friends and time to recuperate and relax - the cost is way beyond its true value. AT LEAST when you push yourself as hard as I did. 

3. FIND THE BALANCE! Get to know your limits  (USE COMMON SENSE) BUT, don't use stories and excuses to not do what you really should do! AKA don't go LAZY! Life is incredibly boring and meaningless if we don't advance towards something that means something to us. As Mark Manson puts it - It's about finding problems that you WANT to solve in life, and then put your energy into doing so.

NOTE - This is 100% my view and perception of life.

&#x200B;

I also did a video on this topic where I go more into detail concerning this topic, and the DAILY HABIT I religiously follow that made me happy again :)

Post 180: My mom don't understand me
Content:
We've been quarantine for really long time and we've been trapped at home. And recently I feel really irritated and annoyed with my mom. Like she always see my disadvantage and always tell all the negative about me. But when I'm with my friends, I'm really positive, cheerful and they all are happy when they are with me. But when I'm with my family, I feel like I'm not being myself. I really don't like it when I'm not being myself and confident.

And you know teenagers we all need our own space and privacy, but I always can't have that.And I hate it when she know that I'm stress, she just started angry at me and asking me "WHY ARE YOU SO STRESS? YOU STRESS FOR WHAT?" Like can't I have stress? Can't I cry? I have feelings too, I'm human too.Sometimes I feel like wanna scream and cry it out loud and can she just understand me a little bit, all she do is angry and screaming.

So how can I cope this problem, I don't really share much my problems to my friends or family but I just feel so irritated about my mom.

Post 181: My 4 tips to help reduce stress
Content:
Hey guys!!

After many years of high school and college, I’m happy to announce that Im officially done with books (computers in my case) to be honest I never thought I would achieve this computer science degree. I plan to take a few months break before starting to apply to companies, Im 24 and I think I will start to work at 25.

In the previous years, I’ve been suffering with a lot of stress and anxiety due to academic pressure and student life in general. I’ve decided to share with you guys some tips that helped get trough this.

1. Don’t be a night owl, just don’t

I know that most of us sleeps really late, scrolling trough instagram feed, TikTok, youtube shorts or watching an whole Netflix series in a single day. Theses are things to avoid because once you start it’s really difficult to stop. Theses habits will take you an incredible amount of time that you should use to get some rest instead. My advice would be to turn off your phone and turn on the sleep mode (iPhone)

2. Get organized

Yeah, I hate this one as I always struggle to organize my stuff. But getting organized will help you release a lot of stress, make sure to use a calendar and write down everything you have to do every week (please don’t use your phone calendar)

3 Exercise regularly

Working out or doing some sports will help you increase your overall mood and has some anti-stress benefits. I’ve noticed that I always get better sleep the days I’ve exercised. It will also increase your self esteem and boost your confidence. I bought a punching bag and some dumbbells, I don’t regret my investment at all.

4 Listen to different genre of music

I realized that I was always listening to the same type of music, drill, rap, heavy trap.  I never gave myself the opportunity to discover other kinds of music. While I was digging a little bit on Spotify and youtube I discovered some new interesting genres like J-pop, jazz and Latin music. I have also realized that listening to instrumentals at low volume helps me a lot during my study sessions. Here are my favorite discoveries!

J-pop | Anri - Last Summer Whisper

Latin | Soha - Mil pasos

Jazz | Grover Washington, Jr. & Bill Withers - Just the two of us

French | Damso - Sentimental

For those who like Lofi instrumentals, I created a Spotify playlist with chill lofi beats with an Asian touch, I listen to it when I study or when I feel like relaxing. 

https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0rtuUABR7FjVo31IVAGF9t?si=We6bcbt0TSGpP5HiVo-P-w

I hope theses tips will help you deal with stress like they did for me, enjoy !

Moved to college for a nursing degree this year, got a job, hit a truck, financed a new car, phone broke, had to finance a new phone, work sidetracked me from my studies and started getting hit on by a creepy older man who was a regular, coworker downplayed it and I couldn’t take it anymore so I quit, found a job at Walmart, quit that too because who the hell stands outside in the rain for 50 cents above minimum wage.

Sister told me to work at this warehouse with her, pays really good money and you can literally pick when you work through an app, didn’t bother to tell me it was through a temp agency and said warehouse can cancel your shifts whenever which they have three times and I can’t even get my foot in the door, my grades were shit this semester and I have to get them up next semester or else I’m kicked out of the nursing program. Applied to a job at the hospital today. I have bills that need paid.

I am so stressed out and I can’t help but cry and get tension headaches from all this stress.

We learned more then 15 chapters in economics within these 3 months and all of those chapters are going to be in the exam. And don’t get me started on maths and accounting.

I feel like crying.

Post 188: You will never truly be able to resolve chronic stress until you redefine your purpose in life.
Content:
**TL;DR: You need to know your internal purpose in order to remove yourself from the "carrot & stick" game.**

# Purpose: Achieve

The initial purpose we learn is to **achieve** as much as possible. When this is your purpose, stress is amazingly effective at getting us to accomplish our to-do list and achieve short-term goals.

I think this comes in part from the "carrot & stick" approach we learn in American schools ([Yale Happiness Lab](https://www.happinesslab.fm/season-1-episodes/making-the-grade)).

If you do well on assignments, you get good grades and move on to the next year. If you do well in HS, you receive a scholarship and go to college. If you do well in college, you get a solid job with high income.

The problem is, this "carrot & stick" game will never end. There is no final carrot. **Continuing to engage in this game mindlessly without a purpose will only lead to more stress & no resolution.** Lifelong happiness requires stepping outside of this game.

&#x200B;

# My Purpose: Long-Term Happiness

My internal purpose is to **maximize long-term happiness**. The thing is, many of our intuitions about "how to be happy" are wrong.

Some data-backed examples that help bring happiness ([Yale Happiness Lab](https://www.happinesslab.fm/)).

* Relationships
* Positive internal predictions about how things will go
* Positive feelings to those around you
* Being moral / having beliefs
* Giving to others
* Writing about painful memories / intrusive thoughts
* Not only thinking positively - we need to prepare for the bad as well
* Meditation / calm mind

&#x200B;

# So, what is your purpose? 

For me, removing myself from "carrot & stick" required learning about what actually makes humans happy. This helped me to redefine accomplishments / career as only **one piece** of my life.

Laurie Santos is the woman who leads the Happiness Lab at Yale and is the creator of the podcasts I listed above. Here is a podcast she did with neuroscientist / philosopher Sam Harris where she provides an overview of what makes us happy: [Podcast](https://samharris.org/podcasts/196-science-happiness/)

*Note: These are my internal armchair ideas. I have enjoyed reading from data-backed positive psychologists like Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, but I am not an academic in the field.*

I have been walking four miles everyday for the past week at a park and while I haven’t lost that much weight, I feel like I have more energy, sleep better, and it helps my self esteem a little bit. I walk alone and it helps that I can go at my own pace.

Content:
I’ve just noticed recently. I’ve got so much random stuff I’m stressed about my mind can wonder and stress out while I’m doing other stuff that normally kept my mind occupied. The most annoying is listening to music, and I don’t mean as background noise. Music used to be a good escape. Now I got a full blown rap coming out of my mouth as fast as it can move and simultaneously have my head stressing out in detail with what ifs about something I need to do tomorrow. Some of my work has a lot of numbers and data entry to it. I can be waist deep in numbers typing away and my mind is stressing out about something stupid in full detail again. I don’t even hold conversations while I’m doing my data work cause I know I’ll mess it up and I can’t focus on both but I can hold an entire conversation in my head and do it somehow. It’s so annoying I have no where to get peace now.

Post 194: feeling stressed and anxious about life, and it really hurts.
Content:
I'm a 19-year-old girl, a senior in college. and my existential crisis is getting worse. as a kid, I've been traumatized by death. I remember clearly the day I learned what it was. I was maybe 4 or 5 years old in a museum (my dad loves visiting them), and I always hated going there because it was very silent, and spacious giving me the feeling that I had swallowed a bowling ball with a million knots in my stomach.  The statues looked so real to me, I thought they were real people staring at us. One of the statues was very intriguing,  it was a woman on a bed being surrounded by angels. I asked my mom what it meant? She answered saying it's most likely she's dead and the angles help her ascend to heaven. And of course, I asked what's death? And she said it's when you leave this world, someday, and you go to heaven or hell. This freaked the hell out of me for so many years. Mom told me that no one knows when we'll day, it could happen anytime. This made of fear the future.  This nothingness that is death is terrifying, to me, even heaven seem scary. Like I always imagine it as a boring white place with nothing going on. I'm more of agnostic, very confused about everything. 

I got into counseling to deal with the stress of the uncertain rather than my existential crisis. It got better and try my hardest to be excited for the future because there's so much that I want to do and achieve. 

But now, it's coming back and making me feel like absolute shit. Because I'm realizing that I'm no longer a kid, I'm an adult, being taken away from those days. I really scared of dying, absolutely terrified. Everything I do now seems meaningless, the things I love like makeup and taking care of myself. I always feel guilty if I waste my time being on the internet, but then if I not doing that I would be reading a book and even that seems unnecessary. I'm afraid of turning old, afraid of the future. On top of that, global warming is making life more anxious. I don't want to live at a time where the world might end in such a terrifying way. I'm making my best to help the environment. But many don't take that seriously. 

I'm also afraid of wasting my youth away. I have strict parents, so I don't get to go out with my friends, do things alone, and I've never experienced love. I know women who are now in their late 30's stuck at their parent's house being sad. I don't want that. 

I want to move out when I have a job, live in another country. But with parents like mine (strict muslim household) they'll refuse. And I'm so scared of doing that, that I won't be happy, filled with guilt, or that it wouldn't work out. Plus, my parents, I really love them, don't want to leave them. But if I stay with them, I won't be able to live my life to the fullest. So I'm in a dilemma. I have to make a decision somehow, because time is running, and must not spend my time chickening out. But I'm in a dilemma. My head is a mess. 

I feel very hopeless, miserable and anxious. 

I feel very lonely, would love to be hugged and loved. 

My faculty happens to be only female, I don't feel that connected to them. And the only friends that I have are far from me, one is on another continent, and the other isn't in my faculty, very busy with work.

Where I am isn't great, it's a country with many issues, and I'm the only foreigner in my uni. The place is quite dangerous, you can't go anywhere without a car and we don't have that. So I'm stuck at home with my thoughts to fuck me all over. I really miss Europe, that's where I grew up. Really hope to move out to somewhere great. 

I just want to be free and happy.

Post 195: Stress eating

I need help with my stress eating. When I'm alone and stressed I can't stop eating. I work out and eat healthy most of the time except when I am stressed. More specifically at night. What are some tips to get it under control?

Post 196: How much is too much?! Somebody tell me...
Content:
I don't even know how to begin writing but here goes..

My long term partner and I split a few weeks ago, and I pushed him away because my mind is swimming. I've got a really demanding job that recently has been piling up with more and more stress. My department was gutted and I'm basically the last one standing - doing the work that 4 people used to do. On top of that, I'm doing a full time accelerated MBA which, until this point, I've been able to handle.

Here's where it get's stupid.. 

I volunteered for a really exciting extra-curricular project and got accepted (yay!). It's a huge initiative and requires hours and hours of reading. The people in my group are incredibly experienced and well versed on the topic (Think Managing Directors/Corporate Sustainability Directors etc) and I feel way out of my depth amongst them, let alone contributing.

I've been practicing yoga 5 days a week which helps, and developed an obsession with incense but my mind is constantly running. 

On top of all of this - the breakup has left me stressed emotionally and financially and I don't have a car to even to my groceries. To go shopping I have to lug around huge bags on either arm and walk 20 minutes to and from the shops, often in muggy and horrible weather.

I know a lot of it is self-induced. The extra-curricular, the MBA, the demanding job, the break up.. but it's beyond the point of return. I can't drop one or any of these stresses. I can't keep on top of everything and feel like the only thing that relieves me is yoga - but I have to do yoga in my lunch break and then I miss out on eating and am stressed that people at work are gossiping because my lunch breaks often go beyond an hour (Due to getting changed, walking to the studio etc).

I needed to type that out. Thanks guys.

I’ve been feeling really stressed with work lately and it’s starting to affect my personal life too.

Content:
I have a sales management job with a large company and been in this role less than a year.  Pay is good/sufficient.
However, I’ve never felt this level of stress and anxiety related to work. It’s impacting my sleep and is on my mind 24/7.  I get physically anxious when I think about some of the leadership meetings I have to attend or present sales projections for. 
I’m wondering at what point does the stress level outweigh the $ and benefits?

Post 200: Stress symptoms persisting long after the stressful elements got removed
Content:
So a few months ago I experienced the most extreme stressful event in my life. I was severely stressed for 4 months.

During that period, I developed an awful brain fog and started having vision problems. But it's been almost 2 months since the elements that were causing me this extreme stress got removed from my life, and I'm feeling way better stress- and anxiery-wise.

But the brain fog and the vision problems persist until today, if not worsened.

Why is this happening?

Post 201: What's everyone's biggest challenge when it comes to blowing off steam after work?
Content:
I work a demanding job where I essentially do 3 jobs in 1. I usually feel so drained after work and the weekends just never come soon enough. I've been a drummer my whole life, and having that creative outlet has always been hugely helpful for me. But, even despite how passionate I am about playing, as my job has gotten more demanding lately, I often find that I just don't have the energy or motivation after a work day to play. I'm curious what other challenges people run into when attempting to blow off steam after work, and/or what things people have had success with.

Post 202: I am so stressed out over everything in my life (Venting)
Content:
As the title says I am stressed about everything in my life right now, so first off I work full time (50 hrs a week on average), I am a full time college student, I was recently kicked out and threatened to be taken to court by my own mother, my car is in the shop and has been since September (luckily I finally was able to get a loaner vehicle from the shop), I really hate my job and have been applying to other places (trying to make career change from security to IT) with no luck so far, I am currently living paycheck to paycheck and can’t afford to live on my own (I have no friends or anyone else I can get a place together with), my life has become auto pilot recently (go to work, come home, do school work, repeat the next day) and all this stress has already taken it’s toll on me as I recently became very sick, I had a fever of 104, and I was diagnosed with colitis in the ER, I was severely dehydrated to the point where my kidneys were on the verge of shutting down and I had lost so much blood that I had to receive a unit of blood as well. I just don’t know what to do anymore, I feel like giving up because all this stress is more than one person can handle, I am not suicidal but I just feel like giving up because I just don’t know what to do, I have no one to truly talk to, I have no friends so I’m forced to just deal with the massive amounts of stress myself

Post 205: Exposed to extreme trauma on the daily
Content:
Hi, I work as an Autopsy Technician. Burnout is starting to get to me. This sort of work chips away at you even if you are the strongest of heart and mind. I'm already in to deep to get out. The job pays okay, but significantly better than any other job I could get in my area, by 8-9 dollars hourly. That and my benefits are outrageously good with bonuses annually, sometimes twice a year. I just don't know what I can do to not feel or be so tense and stressed that isn't self destructive. Therapy only goes so far when you still have to go see and mutilate the bodies of children and babies almost on the daily. That and just horrific crimes in general. I use to think it was cool and it still is in a way, but like I said. Chips away. It's also not a cakewalk to leave it all at the morgue easy. Idk if you have any advice or tips let me know.

I’m a soldier in the US Army, have been for nearly 3 years now. I’m just so fucking exhausted and fed up with my life. My bank account is 300$ overdrawn. I’m taking 2 college classes right now and trying to pick up a second job because I’m paid like shit. I go to group therapy every weekday for my mental and emotional well-being, but that only works so much. I’ve been getting in trouble at work for my attendance (even though it’s really no worse than anyone else’s). Im the hardest damn worker and the guy who does all the extra shit. I meet every physical standard and yet I’m still looked at like I’m a piece of crap. I’ve started drinking everyday as a way to cope and relax but that just sets me back even further than usual. I have a group project as well as 2 essays due Tuesday night and I don’t think I have the time or mental energy to make the deadline. I’m so fucking exhausted and burnt out and everyone’s pretty much telling me to deal with it. I want to die. I’m not able to be the soldier I need to be due to my mental and emotional health and everything on my plate. I feel like I’m imploding and don’t know what to do.

Post 210: When I feel stressed it leads to self loathing
Content:
Hi I'm new to this sub. I often go through this cycle when feeling stressed (and I should note that I get super stressed about tiny mundane things like being forgetful or canceling plans): worry then stress then self loathing.
During this cycle I feel paralyzed by my spiraling thoughts and typically lay on the couch and try to nap it off.

Just wondering if anyone else can relate and if they have tips for managing these feelings. I've started seeing a therapist because I feel these episodes are getting worse and more out of my control.

Thank you!

Post 212: Could this all be stress from an exam?
Content:
Sorry for long post. 25M. The last month I have no clue what’s going on. It started with an internal hemorrhoid that seems to have gone now, but right after my bowel habits changed for the first time in my life. I’m not sure if I was constipated because I was still going in some fashion and it was soft. I also started to get back aches, especially in the lower back. My stomach was really bloated and my back was killing me as I was taking a cpa exam, I’ve wanted to go to the hospital several times but my parents talked me out of it. I took a laxative after my exam and that relieved the back pain and trouble, but since I’ve had an on and off burning sensation in my stomach, lower abdomen, and even thighs at time. The thighs have gone but it almost feels like there is a tight rubber band around my waist at times with an uncomfortable burning feeling. I do have anxiety troubles but I’m in CBT and things have been awesome. My GP said IBS but blew it off, and another GI guy just said Colonoscopy instantly. I saw one more person this week and he gave me some antispasmodics to try first before any colonoscopy. What’s weird is since I talked to him yesterday, the last day and a half, my symptoms have been just about nonexistent. Can’t be a coincidence can it? I haven’t even tried the medication yet and there’s been some burning tonight but not much, and I’m not even sure this is a Gastro issue. I’m trying to pass my last exam and just failed by one point and I take it again next week…could the pressure and stress of this exam be doing this to me?

Hey, ladies and gentlemen. As I stated above, today is my birthday and this day is the first day of the rest of my life. I say this because life has been kicking me pretty hard lately and I take responsibility for that, I don't hide from it.

Right now am I without the job, I have 40 euros on me. That's it. I do graphic design and Youtube stuff like intros, outros, and stuff like that. I contacted at least 300 people in the last 5-7 days, but no luck, so far.

I am a strong individual, it's just that period of life, I guess. I know this will soon be over.

I have decided to make a Youtube channel where I make motivational videos for people who need them regarding their fitness goals, relationship advice, and mental health. You best connect with someone when you have experienced something similar, right?  

**I must say that I believe I am not the best version of myself yet, but that will come in the future while I work on myself in the present.** 

This is my first video, I have Jordan Peterson's (big fan) video as a second one. Please take a moment to watch it, leave a like and a comment.

I appreciate it. Click that subscribe thing, it means a lot to me!

Thank you for reading. Stay focused,

Post 215: So much stress from work...
Content:
The bad dreams and restless nights are returning. Like many others in here, I work in a stressful position. I help clients with our accounting software. It's been very busy with the holidays and everyone trying to get ready for end of the year stuff. I have to meet tight deadlines and assist people that don't know what they're doing.

As mentioned, it's been very busy. I was able to keep up but now I'm falling behind. Im not the only one. When I do call our customers they are usually shitty because of our slow customer service. I had a guy that I was trying to help. He gave me the wrong information, it turned a 15 minute phone call into something that spanned over 3 days.

My boss told me to say something when I get behind. But that usually happens very fast. The boss checks in on me when I'm having a shit day. With the check ins, I get criticized for being behind and not saying anything. This time around, I was doing alright but had about four days where I had cases that needed to be resolved right away. Our company gives us a half day off on Fridays to help with Covid stress. I just had one. Those days, I have half a day to get done with a full day work load.

This job had made me want to walk out. I was urged by my partner to stay. This lead to multiple anxiety attacks. I admitted defeat and was going to quit again. I was encouraged to get on medication, which has helped with the anxiety and some other issues. However, it's getting to the point again where I'm stressing out. My partner has only suggested to get on a higher dose of medication. Im not sure how much stress can be medicated away.

I'm getting to my wits end. Finally I have some vacation days coming. I'm going to use those to look for another job. Hopefully I can find something.

Post 217: This year..
Content:
How many of y'all have had an exceptionally crappy year? Just a series of unfortunate events nonstop ?

I've always had anxiety issues and will literally not sleep or eat until a problem is at least subdued if not resolved. Yet I've also been very very adept at avoiding nonsense and misery in general. All up until this year.

It started with covid making life a bit difficult. We a share that issue though. A bit later in the year a very close family member attempts suicide and that alone brought so many issues that lasted a few months. After that episode my 8 year old cat, my best little dude ,passed away due to severe anemia, and i spent 3k of my savings trying to save him.. Now i have what potentially could be a blood disorder ,if not possible (maybe future) leukemia. Family members have had that shit.. I've slept maybe 10 hours in the last 3 days. And for the first time in years I'm terrified and also for the first time in a long time i broke down in tears for a few hours earlier wishing my cat was here. I miss the fuck out of him. I live by the moto "it could always be worse "but now this time it seems it probably will GET worse.

This year seems to get weirder and weirder. I had so many plans set for this year. I wanted to get a house, take my cat out for car rides more, get a better job , get a home gym ,run more , fix my truck up , go out with friends and maybe find a woman to share my time with. All of that snuffed out and it took my cat with it. I'm in my late 20s and I bust my ass of for my health and wellness and now even that is under heavy threat.

I'm definitely not the only one with these issues. I probably have it great to some of you. It sure does seem odd that this all happens this year though as if darkness is catching up. 

How are y'all doing?...

Post 219: How to not let someone's reaction affect you
Content:
So there's this person at work (that I thankfully don't work under) who has an irrational response to everything. I'm not discounting their feelings, but this person panics at the smallest issue, while no one else around me feels that their reaction makes sense.

Now I'm someone who only gets irritated, but not really angry. This person's response to things actually makes me really, really angry.

How do I not let someone else's emotions affect me? I could really use some help since I'm only just starting off in my career, and I'm likely to meet so many people like this.

Post 220: Spending money on necessities makes me extremely stressed
Content:
Hi I’ve never really posted on Reddit and not sure if I’m doing this right but hi.

I’m really stressed about spending money on anything. I have a decent amount of money right now but I still feel stressed any time I need to make a purchase. I always end up obsessing over the thing I need to buy and I’ll research the product for at LEAST 3 months before I buy it. 

And when I buy the thing I always feel guilty afterwards :( 

Does this happen to anyone else? Any tips on how to not feel guilty?

Post 221: I’m two decades old and I feel like I’ve not achieved anything of value. I feel like a failure in all regards.
Content:
I’m a final year undergrad student, and I feel like I’m already a failure. I’m lazy and undisciplined. My motivation and drive to do things lasts for about ten minutes. I’m disorganised and completely lack self control. I’m very impulsive.

I can’t do things as simple as waking up to my alarm or keeping my room organised. I’m too lazy. 

I have good grades but I don’t feel like I have anything to put in my resume. I have nothing I can call an achievement academically.

I trained in vocal music for 8 years and stopped. I no longer practice because it’s hard work. 

I am a trained dancer but I give up very easily. I’m not as determined to practice as I’d like to be. I always take the easier route.

I want to get back to these. I want to excel in co-curricular arenas as well. I want to get into a good university for my post grad.

I want to develop discipline. I want to not be lazy anymore.

Post 222: Meeting a fellow suicidal student in middle school changed my outlook on life. You really never know what's going on with someone. This is a reminder to just be kind when you can because you don't know what's happening under the surface.
Content:
 I was reading a post that reminded me of a certain conversation I had with a fellow student back in 7th grade.

I was in a lab group with three other kids and this guy who was insanely smart and always cracking jokes rolls up his sleeves. He's got all these scars on them and so another girl in the group asks about them.

He just casually tells us he has a cutting problem. His parents had to confiscate knives and things.

The rest of the group kind of just was like, "OK wow that's scary" and then we just did the assignment. I feel like I missed an opportunity there to help someone out. This guy just opened up about something so personal, and I sort of just was shocked and confused so I didn't comfort him and I didn't say anything touching or kind back.

Honestly, I think I just couldn't process it. Was he joking? For me at least, lots of people joked about depression and suicide all the time in middle school. It had never occurred to me that some of these people actually felt that way.

When I think back on the whole interaction, I realize I would never have known the internal struggle this guy had even existed if I didn't just happen to be in his lab group and he just happened to roll up his sleeves. I'm also really bothered by the fact that no one was concerned in the group, including myself.

Another thing that severely bothers me is the fact that this was middle school. I feel like that's so crazy young and the reality that kids were already facing so much pressure and stress forces me to seriously question what the heck is going on in society right now.

The main thing that this has taught me is that you seriously never know what someone is going through. I would never have guessed that this kid hated themselves like that. He was so smart (I kind of was jealous at times) and he made the wittiest jokes 24/7 and he was always smiling.

I don't know what has happened to him. I think he switched schools the next year or moved or something. Wherever he is, I hope he's doing well and I hope he's found some real support since our school didn't provide it.

Post 223: For those stressed about studies (free tutoring!)
Content:
Hello everyone! My name is Arhan, I’m 15 years old and from Hong Kong. I’ve started a project called CoVidya (Covid as in the virus and Vidya as in the Sanskrit word for knowledge). I would like to pair the many of us who need extra educational support during these difficult times to the many of us who have some spare time and wouldn’t mind donating just an hour or two per week to help someone in need by sharing a skill. 
 
There are a lot of people on this sub. If you feel like you could benefit from a little bit of help with your classes (maybe you can’t afford an expensive tutor, don’t have online classes, or just need a little academic help during these hard times), I really hope my project helps you. It’s 100% free and you can request to be paired with a teacher of whatever class/subject you need help with. Just sign up on my website, [CoVidya](http://www.appvidya.com/covidya) 

If you happen to have some time and know a thing or two about any class/subject/skill you’re good at, please feel free to help someone in need across the world by signing up to tutor. Just an hour a week could make a difference to someone’s life. It’s completely optional but if you’re taking free classes for a topic you need help with and want to give back, teach a topic you are good at to someone else! Or even if you aren’t signing up to be a student, please consider donating some time to help those affected the most by the pandemic. 

The project has already been featured in over 20 newspapers and there are a bunch of tutors signed up and ready, but we need more students too! So please, if you want to push yourself and study a bit while also getting free help, this is for you!

Once again, to sign up to receive or give classes (or both), use this link: [CoVidya](http://www.appvidya.com/covidya) 

Thank you for your time and consideration, stay safe!

Post 228: I get stressed at EVERYTHING... advice please?
Content:
I’ve just taken two weeks off work for anxiety related issues. The anxiety is about my health. 

For the last 4 years, I’ve had constant health issues of one kind or another. It started when my wife had a miscarriage. Abdominal pain, lots of gas... thought it was my appendix. Doctor said it was stress related. 
Then it was glandular fever which caused me to lose weight, lose my appetite, became completely fatigued. More abdominal pain, headaches. Again, was told it was stress related. Thought it was bowel cancer or pancreatitis. 
Then it was muscle pain which I thought was male breast cancer or lymphoma.
Last year, back pain, neck ache, abdominal cramps... had an XRay, blood tests, ultrasounds... all fine!

About a month or two ago, I realised that I had tremors in my hands. Just slight usually when gripping. Also had slight weakness in my knees, pains all over my body in my muscles, twitches. My brain went to MS

I keep getting told it’s stress. Another blood test last week, all fine! I’m being sent to a neurologist and I’m having another ultrasound to check for a hernia. But the doctor thinks it’s stress. 

Here’s the thing. Everything stresses me out. My son wakes me up through the night (he’s 2), my wife is messy, my commute is long, my work is in London and stresses me out, selfish people in cars or on the street, lack of consideration from people, shoddy workmanship, no time to exercise... every, single, thing gets to me. Unless I’m running through the countryside, or sitting watching TV, or having a drink with friends. 

I am so so worried that I’m dying all the time that other little stresses just add to it. And now I’m worried that my heart will give in due to stress. 

How do I get over it and stop stressing about stuff? 

Post 229: Recent Neurology Study Finds 6Hz Theta Wave Binaural Beats Gets You Deep Into A Stress-Reducing Meditative State Faster Than Meditation Alone...
Content:
From the study:

"The brain responses to the 6-Hz binaural beat revealed in this study showed that theta activity was enhanced similar to that observed in a meditative state within just 10 min of exposure. Therefore, a 6-Hz binaural beat on a 250 Hz carrier tone could be utilized as a stimulus for inducing a meditative state, as meditation has several advantages, such as stress reduction. However, achieving such effects via meditation require a deep meditative state that often takes a long period of time. With this binaural beat, a meditative state can be induced in just 10 min and may be more feasibly implemented in modern lifestyles."

I just made this pure 6Hz Theta binaural beats track, like the one they used in the study, for myself to use during meditation. And I  decided to share it on YouTube in case others want to use it to reduce their stress, too.

I find this to be perfect for stress reduction, and have included a link to the study in the description of the video.

Post 230: Serious work anxiety
Content:
I've been having serious anxiety issues at work. I've been at my job for a long time. Moved to a different area of the same job. I am under constant pressure. Feel like I don't know what I'm doing even though I should at this point. I'm always afraid my managers think I'm an idiot. I work really hard but things are constantly blowing up in my face. Sometimes my fault sometimes not. No new training going to happen. I have to learn as I go.

The real problem is im taking the stress home with me. Can't sleep. Can't focus on family things. Mind always racing. I dont want to leave my job. But I don't want to feel like this all the time. I want to not care as much.

When I’m stressed during the day to day types of things, it’s normal for me to get small hives on my neck (typically on the side of my neck). I’ve been used to these symptoms for a few years. 

But now I’m having hives in new areas. This started about a month ago. I’m getting hives on my scalp, back of my neck and my ears during minor daily stressors. It starts on my ears, then goes to my neck, and then my scalp. It is SO itchy. Like makes me crazy! Has anyone experienced this? It’s not an allergic reaction nor lice by the way.

Edited to add: I do suffer from anxiety.

Post 233: Chronic Stress
Content:
For the past 7 years I have been going through this weird mental health thing and I had no idea what was wrong with me. I didn’t exactly align with any of the regular disorders like ADD or anxiety. I knew something was very very wrong with me, I wasn’t functioning at all. I came across the term “chronic stress” and it’s exactly what I have. I wanted to describe how my chronic stress felt to me to see if others have had the same thing.

-feeling like I was in the midst of a white dog like the movie “The Mist”. People would talk to me but I felt they were in the fog and so far away, even if right next to me.

-never being able to be present

-not feeling in my body, like my arms and legs weren’t mine

-body feeling both tense and fatigued at the same time

-feeling a non-stopping buzzing sensation in my brain

-brain feeling both fuzzy and alert

Post 234: Nobody listens
Content:
Nobody listens to the words I say
Only pipe up when I have to pay
Everyone talks over me
Then I get asked why I'm not acting like me

Only care when I'm acting recluse
Not caring when I feel like no use
Not speaking up when I feel out of place
Only making me feel like a waste of space

I know this is too much to handle
But I feel like I must be like a candle
Melt away all the excess waste
Find a smile to put on the new face

Post 236: chronic stress caused by mom
Content:
I feel like there is no solution, but perhaps someone here can share some insights...

This is the 9th year I will be living with my mom. I never thought it would be almost a decade!!

She stresses me out like no one else can. And that is not only wanting to do every little thing for me, but also affording me ver little privacy.

Also, I am never ever just relaxing. This is probably the reason my shoulders and neck are stiff as a plank, my weight doesn't go down, always tired, always on the verge of tears, and a few other minor health issues (let's hope they don't become bigger issues!)

I want to move out but finance does not allow it. 

I gym 3 to 4 times a week, try to eat healthy, sleep 8 hours, take a stack of supplements, but find no joy in hobbies or socializing (mostly because when I get back home she looks at me with doe eyes because why did I go off without her) 

I often play with my budget to see when/if I can move out, but so far no luck.

I am looking into side hustles, but the tiredness, tears, lackluster makes it difficult to focus. 

Something must happen now! I also don't date for the same reasons as above.

Post 237: i'm being negligent at work
Content:
i've been so negligent with everything in my life. my head feels full. i neglected applying for leave early enough and was called out in front of my entire team (indirectly. my name wasn't mentioned). i'm wondering why i did that?? why did i delay applying for simple leave? i feel so guilty and ashamed, but i also have the feeling that i'm beating myself up too much for it 

though, this isn't an isolated incident.

i was meant to deliver assets to another team but neglected to double-check if we had all the assets to deliver. instead, i ignored the issue. the team eventually called me out for it. ideally I should've flagged the issue and had them deal with it... but i was just too lazy?? it wasn't even a big deal. nothing arduous, but i got too lazy. what's worse is that I didn't own up to my mistake.

i feel soooo ashamed, wow. i don't know what's up. i'm slipping lately, in the most tiny, unnecessary ways but it's making me feel so anxious and disappointed in myself.

what is this?? self-sabotage? negligence? why am i failing in the most unnecessary of circumstances?

IDK - just venting here.

I manage a software technician/support team, it's stressful on the best of days and I work 50+ hours a week.  Well we just lost one of our best guys, and our engineers pushed a new release of the software and as fucking *always* QA dropped the ball and it fucked production up and so caused a bunch of extra work for my team (me).

To top it off this coincided with my phone suddenly breaking (screen stopped working, can hear calls come in but can't answer), my wife is out of town, and I'm juggling a 4 and 7 year old.

I feel like I'm going to melt, cry, die...

Post 239: Everything in life is great except my stressful line of work making me feel like it’s better to just end it
Content:
I (20s/F) have everything I could possibly want. I have a house in a nice area, an amazing fiancé that I can’t wait to start a family with, a well paying job… but I feel like I’ve been going insane. 

I’m sleep deprived, can’t take care of myself, can’t be there for my family, fiancé, take care of my house, still wish my fiancé would’ve wanted to elope because I have hated wedding planning cause of my stress and anxiety, and just feel like I’m failing no matter how hard I try. 

I’ve been in this line of work for a few years now, and I have awful anxiety about it, and sometimes it just feels like nothing is worth it …and now that I even have the things I wanted in life, I still don’t want to be here. 

I dual majored in engineering and have worked in the auto industry since I was 18. Due to graduating right when covid hit, I lost all my interview for dream positions, and somehow ended up in supervisor/operations roles at plants. I am extremely thankful for the experience I’ve gotten (I genuinely believe I can do anything after this) and now am doing it with the company I wanted to work for and am on a good shift now instead of night shift. I work my butt off, always have… cause I feel like I’m this industry if I’m not the best I’ll be considered the “bimbo female hire”. I have a lot of support from higher ups and constantly get told I’ll be able to move onto a more technical role outside of the plants sooner than late so it feels like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. However, some days it feels like it’s never going to end… 60+ hour weeks, constant overtime, you receive crap from hourly and the salary above you, pretty hostile work environment, the building should be condemned how nasty and unsanitary it is… you name it. Half the stuff that’s said or done would be HR fireable offenses at the offices. You just become just as crappy if you’re there long enough too. I have constant breakdowns and then feel guilty for feeling that way. I just feel hopeless. Seeing my coworkers getting stuck/held back is adding major fuel to the fire as well. 

Sorry about how ranty this is. Can’t really get my thoughts straight.

Have been getting physically ill from the stresses of a not so good living situation lately.. flu-like symptoms, stomach upsets, fever. This is the second time it's happened in response to this stressor in the span of a month and I was down for the count for a whole week the last time.. had my partner and I take covid tests and everything because we thought maybe it was an actual sickness, but things came back normal. Now I know stress can lead to a weakened immune system, but how do I help reduce my susceptibility to getting sick from it? It's honestly been pretty scary.. I've heard of people having strokes from just stress and that's what happened to my mom so there's a family history there. I've been doing my best to try and take care of myself and ease my mind, watching my comfort shows, listening to my comfort music.. but nothing seems to be helping much. Any advice or support appreciated, honestly just want to know that I'm not alone with this.. it'll be another week of nursing myself and my partner back to health and I hate feeling so bad for no good reason.

I like my work, I like what I do. But I’m also overwhelmed. I have double the work of my coworkers, because I’m very good at my job. But it’s frustrating because I’m a bit behind on the files (about a week and a half behind now), and continue to get more behind as more and more are assigned to me.  
And then one of my coworkers was able to have a full hour person phone call because of the free time he has. It’s frustrating.   
I’m also in grad school, and took 2 courses during summer so I just don’t have the time to work OT and get caught up.  
I also cry sometimes when I get overly stressed. I also have a few diagnoses (bipolar 2, adhd, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder), which I’m still in the process of finding the right mix of meds. There was short period of time where I cried at least once a week. The first time my boss had been around when I cried she made me feel like I was too weak to handle the job. But continued to assign me files. Since then I have avoided crying when she’s in the office. 
I was talking to my bf tonight. Kept talking over me, and would barely let me get a sentence out. And when I raised my voice to tell him he was talking over me he diverted the conversation to me yelling at him instead of acknowledging he was talking over me. He said he wasn’t talking over me. And then called me weak because I cry from work.  
I can’t talk to my friends about it, because my boss is part of the friend group so I don’t want her to think I’m still weak.
I have a tendency to change jobs every year and a half so I’m not trying to do that again.  
I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading.

Post 247: Why am I still stressed out about schoolwork even though school is out for the summer?
Content:
I just went through a prolonged period of stress due to AP exams, interviewing for/working a new job, final projects, SATs, getting behind in schoolwork, getting worse end-of-year grades than usual, and grieving over my pet hedgehog dying (I really loved him and it was really awful when he died).

I am not a "crier" in any way usually. Up until about a week ago, I couldn't remember the last time I cried. Now, even though that period of stress has passed and it's now summer break, I feel like I could cry at any moment if I wanted to. I can understand that, of course, because I'm still recovering from all that emotional overload, but what I can't understand is why I still feel stressed about SCHOOLWORK specifically.

Every time I try and think about planning what I'm going to do this summer, I start to get the same anxiety I feel with schoolwork deadlines, studying for tests, or anything else school related. Even though I try to tell myself that I have no schoolwork left, my brain somehow just doesn't believe me?? 

I feel like I can't do anything fun this summer because I'm so busy with schoolwork even though I literally have no schoolwork to do at all. Why is this happening and how do I move on so that I can actually enjoy my summer break? It's making me even more anxious and sad thinking about how excited I normally am for summer and how I'm just wasting my summer away feeling absolutely miserable. It's 4:45 am right now and I'm sitting awake in bed writing this because I can't sleep. Help!

Hi everyone. I am senior student in Grade 12 and I have AP Bio and Chemistry 12 in the same semester. Very recently I became overwhelmed with the amount of homework and constant tests/quizzes that I cry every other day, and I’m at the point where my Mental health is not safe, anymore. Somedays, I often just want to give up on these tests and just don’t care what happens in these courses. This issue occurred in Grade 12 only as in Grade 10 I would have the same exact amount of homework and I would never experience mental breakdowns like this. I would just sit there and do homework and then all of a sudden break down and cry out. I don’t know if this is signs of early depression, too much anxiety, can someone please help me out?

Post 252: Having a semi busy schedule stresses me out. Need advice
Content:
Whenever I have one or two things going on after work I feel as though I don't have enough time to relax. I feel as though I can't handle a busy schedule and even having a few things to do during the weekend stresses me out and gives me anxiety because I really enjoy time to myself. 

Does anyone know how I can get over this without feeling stressed/anxious all the time? 

I know people who have super busy schedules... they work extra hours, have children (I don't) and somehow still make time to learn new skills in their spare time. I really admire people who can keep busy schedules and somehow not breakdown. 

How do people like that not get stressed by all the stuff they do? I really want to be able to do more during my day to get somewhere in life, but I feel too stressed out when I do "too" much.

Is it partially because I'm an introvert? I know I have anxiety to work through but I don't know where to start...

Thanks in advance.

The last two months has more stress than in the last few years. My Mother died last month. My Aunt dies two weeks ago. I work on a construction site as the only safety guy for 170+ workers. This COVID shit has caused me to not see my mother or aunt. My Father sits alone in his house in a different city. I am constantly dealing with positive cases of COVID putting myself and my family at risk. My wife has COPD and am pretty sure if she gets it it wont turn out well. Monday a small breakout of COVID happen and today a much larger outbreak happens. I have had to shut my door and lock it to stop all of the complaints. I am sure we are doing everything we can to help prevent the spread but it is starting to get to me. I don't want to be here but I have to be. I am so tired of all the anti mask issues from people. I just want it all to go away but it will not.

I ended up going to school part-time, and taking two jobs to try and chip away at my debt... but the work has been very overwhelming and having to balance all of this is taking its toll on me.

Post 265: Stress - An Overview and Reduction Techniques
Content:
*All of us are experiencing elevated levels of stress in one way or another right now. So what even is stress? Stress is a hormonal response that is activated when a threat is perceived to be greater than our ability to adapt or cope. We experience two different types of stress; acute & chronic. Acute stress is experienced short term & is often situational or incident based, like an argument or a physically strenuous task. Acute stress may even bolster or increase the bodies innate and immunologic responses. Chronic stress tends to have the opposite effect and is defined as the response to the emotional pressure suffered for a prolonged period of time during which an individual perceives they have little to no control; work/home conflicts/expectations, anxiety, mental worrying, global pandemics…. I bet this sounds a little bit familiar right now.* 

*In a healthy body cortisol levels naturally cycle throughout the day in tandem with you circadian clock, peaking sometime mid morning and falling to its lowest level just before midnight. Chronic and acute stress both disrupt this natural cycle – this is part of the reason we have trouble settling in or falling asleep after a particularly stressful encounter – our cortisol level was peaked late in the day and is interfering with our physiological ability to relax.* 

*Many different cellular interactions occur along the hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis when stress is perceived, that lead to the secretion of glucocorticoid hormones including cortisol and norepinephrine. These hormones are responsible for our fight or flight response that physically manifests as increased blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, slowed digestion, changes in blood flow and blood chemistry that in acutely stressful situations, like self defense, are actually life saving mechanisms.* 

*When a person lives with chronic stress the hormonal response of the HPA axis is actually decreased due to fatigue, while at the same time we become even more sensitive to stress causing stimuli. Chronic stress manifests itself in several physical forms including insomnia/disrupted sleep, high blood pressure, poor appetite/indigestion, muscle tension, headaches and you guessed it – skin problems! The skin actually has it’s very own periphery HPA axis so it communicates directly with your brain about stress! Stress signals from your brain activate your skins HPA axis leading to the release of inflammation creating cells and hormones that increase damage from oxidative stress & UV stress, suppress immune activity, increase irritation cause by allergen exposure and susceptibility to infections. Stress also activate skin cells called mast cells – mast cells are implicated in a variety of chronic dermatologic diseases including acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and pruritus ( itching ). The onset or start of these chronic skin diseases are frequently preceded by a traumatic or emotional event in the previous 6 months.* 

*TLDR; Stress is hard on your skin, ages you faster, reduces your immune function and ability to heal. Stress is literally poison.* 

Stress can seem insurmountable at times but DO NOT STRESS ANY FURTHER! There are a whole bunch of things you can do to reduce your perceived stress, support and heal your body! Ive pulled together some basic information and instructions for three evidence based stress reduction techniques that you can learn on your own and practice ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, FOR FREE! The most important part of any stress reduction practice is giving yourself enough time to learn these practices and be consistent in their daily use!

* **Technique : Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**

PMR was developed by American physician Edmund Jacobson in the 1920’s. Dr. Jacobson believed that by learning how to consciously relax the muscle tension that accompanies anxiety one could also conciously “relax” or lower their anxiety levels. PMR focuses on the intentional and focused tensing and relaxing of specific muscle groups in sequence. PMR practice consists of tensing up a muscle group for 10 seconds and then resting for 20 seconds before moving onto the next muscle group. PMR requires a person to focus on differentiating the feelings of tension and relaxation in various muscle groups and is both mentally and physically involved. Start with the muscles in your feet, flexing and relaxing your toes, arches, ankles, calves, quads/hamstrings, buttocks, abdomen/lower back, chest/upper back, neck, facial muscles and then working your way backwards in order to your toes. PMR is an excellent relaxation technique, especially before bed , I personally have been using this technique to fall asleep since my grandfather taught it to me as a little girl! To see the greatest stress reduction results PMR should be practiced for 15-20 minutes daily; long term benefits have been show to include reduced salivary cortisol levels, reduction in anxiety, lowered blood pressure and heart rate, and fewer headaches.

* **Technique: Diaphragmatic Breathing** 

Focus on breath or intentional breathing is a well established relaxation technique that is traditionally seen in yoga and has been incorporated into many modern relaxation programs. Diaphragmatic breathing also known as belly, abdominal, or deep breathing; Deep breaths through the nose that focus on the expansion of the diaphragm and abdomen when inhaling and forcefully expelling air through the mouth when exhaling by pushing from the abdomen, defined as breath manipulation. The physiological responses characterized by diaphragmatic breathing are decreased oxygen consumption, heart rate, blood pressure, increased theta brainwave expression and increased parasympathetic activity accompanied by the experience of alertness and invigoration. Current hypotheses are that voluntary slow breathing resets the autonomic nervous system and synchronizes autonomic functions. Diaphragmatic breathing can be used as needed; in stressful situations, to increase alertness or even just take a moment to rest and re center. To get the greatest benefit, Diaphragmatic breathing should be intentionally practiced for at least 3-5 minutes a day; with regular practice people have experienced reduced fatigue and anxiety. Diaphragmatic breathing has also been used to influence autonomic function to help reduce hypertension, aggression, stress and migraines.

* **Technique: Relaxation Response** 

Developed at Harvard in the 1960’s by Herbert Benson. It was discovered that there is a counterbalancing mechanism to the stress response; just as stimulating an area of the hypothalamus can incite a stress response so activating other areas of the brain results in the reduction of the stress response- this state of non stress and the transition to it is called the relaxation response. Relaxation Response is a simple practice that requires 15-20 minus of focus per day, the most important characteristics of any Relaxation Response program are 1) the repetition of a word, sound, prayer, thought, phrase, mantra or muscular movement through which concentration is achieved and 2)a passive return to the repetition when other thoughts intrude or interrupt. Stress creates a specific physiologic response in the body and when the perceived threat has passed the body will return to its baseline, reducing heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and other physical fight or flight symptoms, this is referred to as the relaxation response. By focusing your practice on your own relaxation response you can build greater control over your autonomic response to stress, the long term benefits of a focused relaxation response program have been observed to be lowered systolic hypertension and improved cardiac rehabilitation. Evidence also exists to suggest that relaxation response practice in short term and long term alters certain gene expressions, it is believed that this may be the mechanism for the long term health effects of Relaxation Response practice.

*On top of trying out one or all of these tested stress busting methods you can also remember the good old rules of feeling good; eat whole foods that make you feel good, get at least 6-8 hours of rest in each 24 hour cycle, drink more water, and be kind to yourself.*

Post 266: Help with managing stress
Content:
Hi All,

I’m hoping for some recommendations/advice.

I feel that on a day to day, I now manage my stress pretty well. That is, until something goes wrong and then I fall apart.

CBT has helped with managing a lot of daily stressors, but it feels that I reach so quickly to unexpected events, that I can’t put these techniques into action.

For example, yesterday, I had a plumbing issue in my house (water flying everywhere). I almost had some kind of breakdown over it. Full on sobbing and panic, beyond what I would perceive to be a normal level.

This type of stress/panic is sporadic as it only occurs when there is something unexpected happens. 

Can anyone suggest any kind of ways to manage this?

Thank you

Hi, what are the best scientific books about stress?  
Like, about what's happening in your body and brain? And how did/does it serve us? etc.  
Looking forward for suggestions. Thanks!

Post 270: Looking for an outlet for stress
Content:
I've been under so much pressure for a very long time. I feel angry a lot and I dont want to hurt others. I want to take out my anger physically in a way that wont hurt anyone. Like a literal punching bag. Does anyone know of things like that? Working out doesnt count, I want to feel like I'm really hitting something and just physically beating on something.

Post 271: how do I stop eating when stressed
Content:
I’ve been under a lot of stress lately, and the only thing I can think to do is eat. I just ordered a burger, finished that, then ordered a pizza. I can hardly even afford this, but I can’t stop myself.  I can’t even say I feel any better while/after eating. I feel absolutely disgusted with myself and I don’t know what to do anymore.

Post 272: Shitty family
Content:
I hate my Mom and Dad, nobody is in my side and My Mom would try to humiliates me. My Mom's personality is shitty and my Dad is obsessed with her because she have plastic surgery to make her look good. I am done with this family, when I have a job I will move out and live my own life. My Dad is a bully since I was little, bully me and tell me to go kill myself before. My mom poured bucket of dirty water on me in front of everyone last year in the beach because she thought I did something and never apologized. In the edge of falling in depression again. Plus I moved to Pennsylvania for 6 months, lost all my friends. If I were honest of how I felt, I would say I have been sad for 6 months straight, I always feel alone but I get happy if I talk to anyone online and sad all over again. My aggression came from all the bullshit I came through for years, reached out for help ended up lying for *THEY'RE* sake and yells at me. Involved police and cases in our house many times and investigation for 4 years straight. Really tired of this, I dont care if I'm rich or not. I just want love and affection that I've missed throughout my childhood. Can you believe being so sad for 6 almost 7 month straight? Seriously nobody cares about me. Even my best friend if I were honest, is nothing to be half of the time. I am always there for her when she is sad but, HOW ABOUT ME?!?!!??!? I'M so sick of this shit!! I got almost all straight A's in my school but unlike other parents and families, they don't even care how well I do they only care that I go to school. I want to live but I am struggling to catch up. Help?? So sick of this, this is why I dont even like to go out to vacations because i always know it is going to be a disaster and then be all blamed on me, -sincerely, me in the beach unhappy being blamed again on a vacation.

Post 273: I feel stress every day and apparently it's not normal?
Content:
My whole adult life has been filled with stress, either lots of it before looming deadlines or smaller doses of every day stress like a general sense of worry about money, career, social interactions, time, etc. My partner doesn't experience this; he doesn't worry about something unless it's about to happen, because in his opinion, worrying won't help the situation. He's been down to his last $200 in a foreign country before and managed to find a job before his money ran out, so i guess his lack of stress was justified. He tells me all the time that I shouldn't be stressed so much because there's no point in doing so.

On the other hand, I stress about everything because I feel that if I'm not stressing, I won't be prepared for when something unexpected happens. Like if I have a leaking pipe and need to spend thousands fixing the damage. How do you not feel the urgent need to make sure you have enough money to prepare for something like that? 

What's normal? Is it normal to be stressed every day? Or is it normal to not be stressed unless something big is about to occur? How do I stop worrying about things that are rationally beyond my control when a part of me believes that if I can anticipate it, I'll be prepared for when it happens?

Ugh. Now I'm stressing about whether I'm too stressed. Life is stressful. Any ideas on how to stop stressing about every little thing?

Post 274: Sophomore in high school, I don’t care about it anymore and I’m slipping.
Content:
For some background I’ve always been a good student. Always in mostly honors (in 6th grade I got kicked out of honors math but it was for the best) and teachers usually like me. But this quarter has just left me completely empty of giving a shit about school. I have a job, I’m in band and jazz band, and I I still like those but I hate school now. I’ve never had this much resentment towards it in my life and I just fucking hate it. I don’t know why or how this started but it’s causing me to slip. This quarter just ended and my lowest grades were C+, one in chemistry and one in my honors English class. My dad told me I need to figure out why I got F’s in certain assignments but I just don’t have the heart to tell him I barely worked on them. I don’t feel like I’m lazy because I’m constantly working, but I’m also not putting in the work. I feel so fucking inadequate, I have friends in way tougher classes that are upset that they have an A-. My parents never praise me for good grades, they only ever bring it up when I have less than adequate. What should I do? If I’m not already burnt out I think I might be getting there. 

Post 275: The worst thing about stress is that I don't even remember what I like to do, so I can't relax by doing it.
Content:
I have about fifteen different pieces of paper (well, .doc files) that about five people are expecting from me ASAP. I've been trying so hard to sort it out, but yesterday I came to realize that I actually *can't* unless I get my heart rate just a little bit lower.

But anything I try to do to relax myself - talking with friends, my girlfriend, video games, hobbies - is torn up instantly by my brain, telling me I need to do the things I "need" to do. What am I supposed to do, when I have to relax but relaxing just stresses me out more.

Post 276: What is it called when someone is so stressed they snap at the first thing that draws their attention?
Content:
Last night I was cooking dinner for my gf while she was setting up a sprinkler in the front yard. She had been out there by herself for several minutes while I was working in the kitchen not knowing that the following factors were causing her to become stressed: a weak hose that kept kinking so water wouldn’t flow through it, the three neighbors dogs barking at her through the fence (they were within three feet of her, and trying to connect two hoses that did not want to fit. 
When I finished getting dinner ready, I happily went outside to let her know dinner was ready. Up to this point we had been having a lovely evening and I never suspected anything was wrong so my mental and emotional defenses were down and I was not expecting anything. After I told her dinner was ready I stood waiting for some response while keeping our dog busy, mowing she might get in my gfs way. She turned around a yelled,”You don’t have to rush me!” And went back to doing what she was working on, clearly angry. 
I had no response and could only stammer that I wasn’t rushing her and finally gave up and went inside and sat on the couch to figure out what had just happened.
This isn’t the first time she has snapped at me when I am not the source of stress on her but after the inevitable argument and makeup she told me how she had been stressed by all the things I had listed and believed I had come out to hurry her along to dinner. 
She is seeing a therapist now for about a year but only once a month but I think she should be seeing them about twice a month but she always has excuses why she can’t. So I want to know how I can avoid her snapping at me like that again in the future. How do I keep her from getting stressed out by ordinary, as I see them, things?

Post 277: Can you get tonsillitis due to stress or period?
Content:
Been to the doctor several times, I get tonsilitis every month, sometimes if I am really stressed I get it twice that month. I have asked to have them removed but it such a long process in the UK. I just would like to know if this is a common thing and if more people suffer from tonsillitis at an adult age and get it as often as me.

Hi /r/stress subscribers

This sub had been abandoned long ago by its creator and I'd like to see it get turned around as an active place for discussion of stress rather than simply links by blogspammers. It's going to take a couple days to add some more mods and clear out the spam queue, but hopefully you'll see marked improvement when all is said and done. 

Post 279: Everything is just so overwhelming right now
Content:
Everything is too much right now. This is probably one of the worst days I’ve had in a while.
I got a 33 on my math test and dropped from a high B to almost a D. I have a late fee I have to pay for an overdue book for school, I took an AP quiz which I think I bombed, and my dentists just told me I have six cavities to fill. I’m not getting enough sleep and I’m really struggling to beat a bad addiction right now.
Worst thing is the book I’ve been trying to work on for years isn’t panning out, and I know I have to restart.
Today is the first time that I’ve cried for months, and now I’m super embarrassed because of it. I’m so stressed and anxious at everything right now. Everything is really just hurting me here.

I just wanted to share this to some other people, sorry if this doesn’t fit the sub.

Post 280: What has actually helped you cope with work stress and burnout?
Content:
Depending on what survey or report you read, the number of people suffering from work related burnout and stress is pretty staggering, ranging from 50%-80% globally.

I wanted to reach out to the sub here and see if you have been personally affected by work related stress/burnout? and more importantly, how did you cope with it? was there anything in particular that worked for you?

Have you tried common advice like relaxation/mindfulness, exercise, eating healthy? or did you try something a bit more unconventional or a unique approach?

Post 281: Feeling Overwhelmed and Depressed – Need Advice
Content:
Hey everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. I'm writing this because I don't really know where else to turn, and I’m feeling pretty desperate for some advice and support.

Lately, I've been feeling incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out. It seems like no matter what I do, I can’t shake this constant feeling of anxiety and depression. I've been struggling to keep up with my responsibilities, both at work and in my personal life, and it’s all starting to take a serious toll on my mental health.

To give some context, I'm balancing multiple demanding projects at work while also trying to find a new job. The pressure to succeed is immense, and I'm constantly worried about failing or not being good enough. My perfectionism only makes things worse, as I often feel like I need to excel in everything I do.

On top of all this, I’m trying to learn new skills and grow professionally, which adds another layer of stress. It feels like there’s always something more to do and never enough time to do it. The weight of all these responsibilities is just so heavy.

I don’t have many people to talk to about how I’m feeling. It’s hard to open up about just how much I’m struggling right now. I'm finding it hard to sleep, my appetite is all over the place, and I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown. I try to take breaks and practice self-care, but it never feels like enough. The feelings of hopelessness are overwhelming.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope with the overwhelming stress and feelings of depression? Are there any techniques or strategies that helped you find some balance and peace? I would really appreciate any advice or words of encouragement. Thanks for reading.

Post 282: stressing about being stressed
Content:
I know I sound like a dumbass but I'm stressing about the fact that I'm so stressed so it's just a whole cycle I go through.

stress has honestly caused me a lot of health problems and I just wanna know how I could manage it better? (stressing about my health problems only leads to even more stress so I can never really get out this cycle)

Post 283: Did you ever struggle to decide if your issues were a physical health problem or just chronic stress?
Content:
For me, my life was going along as normal, until randomly I started feeling really bad during exercise.

I used to be able to hike 10-15 miles easy, now any amount of exercise triggers physical symptoms and a bad stress response.

**I seriously have to keep physical activity down to about 40-45 minutes of just walking, otherwise my mood is ruined for like a week, I get stomach pains, tinnitus, sometimes weird blurry vision, disturbed sleep, pains around my body etc.**

Sometimes when I'm walking I get lightheaded and feeling like I'm not quite balanced.

I don't know why it came on all of a sudden. There was no trauma and to be honest, I didn't even feel particularly stress before all of this happened.

I don't know if this is a physical health issue, but it's been 7-8 months now, and docs have done test after test and are still not sure what it is.

I did an antibody test which suggests I had covid at some point but never remember having it.

**TL;DR- Does this sound like chronic stress to you? Did it stop you from being able to properly exercise?**

I'm doing meditation, breathing, short walks, healthy eating, gave up gluten, no alcohol , no cigarettes, drugs etc. 

Post 284: Inflammations and stress
Content:

*Inflammation and stress*

- I lowered my expectations, changed my mindset towards situations this lowered my stress. *I was making so much cortisol my nervous system got inflammed and I felt stressed.*
- I quit weed and cigarettes this lowered my stress. *I was mistreating my lungs untill they got inflammed and I felt stressed.*
- I'm changing my diet now. *I ate too many bad foods; my bowels, hands, feets and shoulders hurt and are inflammed, and I feel stressed because of it.*

*Resilliance*

- I started to exercise (walk, jog, cycle, gym) to increase my physical resilliance.
- I'll start eating healthy and nutricious food to increase my physical resilliance.
- I started to meditation and mindfulness to increase my mental resilliance.

I have changed the way I view stress symptoms, they are just a warning we're doing something wrong and we have to change.

Post 285: Why am i constantly stressed?
Content:
I worry about everything. ALL THE TIME. My mind never stops and i don’t know why i’m like this. My mom is the same, so i guess that could explain some of it?

How do i get better?
I overthink every single thing and it’s taking over my life.
I even have stress dreams. Missing my flight, forgetting someone’s birthday, losing a loved one, etc,.

Post 286: Anyone feel like they handle stress very very poorly? Like everything is tenfold compared to how a normal person can handle stress?
Content:
I’ve always felt like since I was a teenager, I can’t handle stress at all! Everything is a hundred times worse. Idk why I’m like this, but stressful events just make me feel worse. I do suffer from anxiety and depression, and of course obviously that makes everything harder to cope with. How do you guys handle stress??

Post 287: Stress immediately after waking up
Content:
Does anyone else experience insane stress as soon as they wake up? Every day when I wake up I feel incredibly tense everywhere and in a really bad mental state.

Post 288: I'm extremely stressed, need someone to discuss it with (maybe at length)...
Content:
I just don't see this stress ever coming to an end. I can't manage my life!

  
There's too much that needs to be done. Too little I can do. Too much I want to do.  
I could quit rest, leisure and hobbies, but that'd just make things worse.  
I think I really really need someone else to discuss this with.  
  
I struggle with perfectionism and toxic productivity.  
All my life I've just dealt with depression - and now that I've overcome depression, I realize I have literally no idea how to manage my stress, anger, other issues....  
  
Please comment or message if anyone thinks they can help

Post 289: Have you guys ever experienced a wave of stress pass through your brain?
Content:
This happened to me last year when I was studying for my math mock test and I was really really stressed about it because there were a few chapters I still hadn’t covered, and on the day before my mock while I was solving some math problems this wave of stress passed through my brain (at least it felt like that)

Post 290: What gives you clarity in your life and creates inner peace
Content:
So here’s a thing that can help you a lot if you are not quite sure where to go in life and you want to have a feeling of inner clarity. Because inner clarity is creating outer clarity.

I myself was struggling for years with this constant feeling of doubt and uncertainty in my chest. I made a few right decisions and was lucky to work with mentors on my mindset and here’s what helped me the most in gaining an inner sense of clarity, peace and serenity. (In most situation, sometimes life hits me in the face very hard as well but that’s part of the game that we somehow happen to be in 😅)

The problem is that we are always looking outside for guidance on how to live our life instead of looking insight and figuring out our own idea of a life worth living. That’s probably nothing new for you but you might ask yourself where to start?

Looking and DEFINING your core values is a great way to do that. I see values as kind of trail markers. Whenever we have to make a decision to make in life and we are not quite sure which path we should go down, we can always look at our values and decide after them. For example if you defined freedom as one of your core values, you want to make decisions that are likely to bring you the most freedom. And that’s what you do on a daily basis.

In that way you’re not only always sure in which direction you want to go, but also you can just give a sh\*t from now on what other people have to say about you because you are a human being that know himself and is sure about himself.

Post 291: Stress and dizziness
Content:
Had anybody else experienced dizziness or being light-headed when you're stressed or anxious?

Occasionally over the past few weeks I've experienced it, currently going through a house move and dealing with my new promotion as a manager at work so I do feel as though I've had prolonged stress at the moment.

Thanks.

Post 293: Feeling paralyzed

Sometimes I feel so stressed that my body feels paralyzed. I can’t move, think, talk, feel, etc
Is it normal ?
And how can I deal with it?

Post 294: Healthy ways to deal with constant stress?
Content:
I mean constant. Never ending always there stress. Even when I’m relaxing, I’m stressed about the next day or something unrelated. I don’t know how to stop.  

I just started a job, I’m 18 so I thought it was time to work. I’m in a bit of a bad depression patch right now where I don’t wanna do anything even things I enjoy. My mom wanted me to do the job. We are about to spend 400+ dollars on things I need for the job so no going back now, I feel trapped. 

And the thing is, I like the job. I’m learning to be a dog groomer, but I’m so scared I won’t be able to have down time to unwind. School is already extremely overwhelming and hard to get through. How can I cope with this? I need help

Post 295: Being a single parent, working, and going to school is killing me
Content:
I love my son. He is my rock, my world and the reason I am pushing myself. But, it’s reached a point where I am breaking. I hardly eat because I don’t have time to cook and prepared foods are expensive and unhealthy. I’m buried in school work already, I have to work to earn a paycheck and my son has needs too. I had been having awful migraines last semester and now they are back and this time I am nauseous too. I was dry heaving for 20 minutes. Right now my head hurts so bad that I am seeing flashing lights and feeling dizzy. I tried eating a banana and some crackers and drank some coffee, but it hasn’t lessened. I don’t know what to do. I am out of PTO due to covid and can lose my job for calling out, which I don’t wanna do because I have so much on my plate already.

Post 296: I’m burnt out
Content:
Fuck school and fuck this school system. I’m in a constant state of stress. I have panic attacks and I cry everyday at school as well as when I get home. I’m taking AS levels and the thought of me writing the exams in a few months keeps me panicked. I’ve withdrawn from my social life due to the stress and I feel miserable. I feel like im being suffocated. It’s all an ongoing loop and I feel stuck . I genuinely cannot imagine myself surviving next year too. Everytime I sit down to study, I have mental breakdowns . I just have 1 more year to graduate

Post 297: Has anyone experienced premature ageing?
Content:
To fly through my background I was abused pretty heavily growing up and have always been very hyper vigilant. Meaning I've had a lot of stress my entire life. Recently I've started to take notice of how old I and others look. I'm obsessed with guessing how old people are, whenever I find someone who I think is my age or looks as old as I do I find they're at least 5 years if not 10 years older than me. I'm only 21 and I feel like I already look older than my 6 year older brother. My cheeks are hollow and my hair is thin. My skin looks rough and my skin complexion is uneven. It's rough. I don't know how to accept this. It feels so unfair and I'm struggling to deal with it. I obviously don't KNOW if I'm any older than I am and am looking into having my biological age tested but all the physical and cognitive markers or age are showing. Has anyone else dealt with this? I feel like I've had 10 or so of the best and healthiest years of my life stolen from me.

Post 298: Gratitude is a huge stress reliever
Content:
With the stress and chaos of this world, it  is no wonder why we all are like tightly wound balls that could explode at any moment.  

 It's  an extremely trying time for us all.

But it doesn't have to be...

There are little things we can do on a daily  basis to bring back our mental sanity and to bring us back to our place of peace and calm.

Besides meditation, one of the best thing that works for me is a daily gratitude practice.  

When we focus on gratitude daily, we block out the negative and multiply the positive.  The practice literally transforms our world!

Post 299: Having a bad day(s)
Content:
It’s one of those day(s) where it feels like an anomaly. All day today, at work, I have been making mistakes left and right and scrambling to fix them as fast as possible. 

On top of that I am having the worst time understanding people as in just misinterpreting what people are saying and being confused with others’ communication. 

It’s making me feel so pent up and anxious and I don’t know what to do with all of this negative energy and anxiety. It feels like my body is going to explode and scatter everywhere. I just want it to end. Get whatever this is over and go back to normal.

Post 300: Everything has fallen on me and I'm stressed out
Content:
I'm already spread thin and stressed to the max.  My husband is out of town for two weeks for family reasons and I feel overwhelmed with everything. We also haven't been apart for more than a few days in 9 years.

The last few says have been especially rough. I've been having to drive home in the middle of the day to let our dog out and and give her meds. We have opposite schedules so he usually does those things before he goes to work. I don't always find parking again when I get back from taking care of her either. We adopted another dog right before he left too which I was hesitant to do. In just 3 days he's already needed to go to the vet twice. Once to look at his neuter incision and again later this week for what appears to be allergies or a virus. We have another dog who's been with us since before we got married. She's undergoing chemo treatment but is doing well. I worry about her catching something if he's sick. I've been sleeping on the couch the past few nights to keep him apart from her because she sleeps in our bedroom and he doesn't need to be jumping on the bed. He also wakes himself and me up multiple times a night because of his stuffy nose. On top of all that, I ran over a bunch of nails in the road and of course one got into my tire. I'm also struggling with school right now.

I'm stressed and frustrated all around. My husband left to his dad's home country to bury him and spend two weeks with his family there. I'm glad he was able to go, but I feel bad that part of me is upset with him about leaving this long. I took on all the responsibilities we share plus extra so he could go. He hasn't even been gone a week yet. I don't know how I'm going to keep everything up until he gets back. My stress management techniques are poor. Other than sleeping, there's nothing that helps me alleviate stress.

Post 301: don’t want to grow up
Content:
i don’t want to grow up. the thought of becoming an adult is overwhelming. 
the cost of living has risen so much, do you seriously expect me to be able to fund myself, a home and bills with minimum wage?
the pressure of needing to do well academically is stressful. i know im smart, but in regards to how smart i am in comparison to others my age. i feel i am nothing. 
im strong minded and driven but im not inherently a genius, nor do i have the skill set of one. 
i lack versatility, perseverance and self discipline.
i give up easy and lose hope upon the slightest bit of ‘failure’.
i do not have a large skill set and therefore rely too much of my ‘strengths’ compromising and over performing to make up for my inability to do well at other skills. 
deep down i know the persistence to attend university is understandable but ultimately what does it leave me with?
debt? stress? no guaranteed job/salary to match my years of education?
i genuinely worry i will become a useless adult.
i have no doubt there’s far more capable people than me who have more potential who would be a better fit into society. 
im currently young and beautiful but that will only get me so far.
even now i have overwhelming waves of sadness that make me feel sick to my stomach. i can’t imagine how ill deal with that as an adult. 
i indulge in self pity too much which in turns only makes me feel more pity for myself as it makes me hyper aware of my existence and how lost i am.
though i am beautiful i feel that can only get me so far. my intellect feels inferior than those around me and i feel as if the best i will ever amount to is mediocrity. 
though im not an adult yet im already theorising what to do with my life if i fail at becoming an one.

edit: for people asking 16f, i have a job but it’s just fast food. im strongest in fields such as the humanities in particularly history and politics, literature, visual arts and textiles. however my weaknesses are maths (my head struggles to grasp anything that’s not basic math), and most sciences however i am passing my psychology class which i like.

Post 302: Just a reminder to eat healthy when you're stressed. A stressed body is a damaged body, we need nutrients, vitamines, minerals, water and rest to repair the damage.
Content:
And stay far away from foods that stress the body more, like sugars, white flour products and processed/factory foods.

Take care of your physical, mental and emotional well-being and protect it with setting boundaries (towards yourself and others). It takes practice, but feels very rewarding when you protect to greatest and most important person in your life.. yourself.

Post 303: Feeling a bit "out of mind" and at 95%ish of my cognitive capabilities, blood tests okay, anyone experienced this?
Content:
Ok so I know reddit is not the best place for medical advice but I also want some strangers' opinions.

I've never experienced stress/anxiety problems, even under pressure with uni/work, but I put a lot of pressure on myself in many other aspects of my life and a couple of years ago I started getting a bit of shortness of breath, checked with the doctor in case it was Asthma but it was alright and with time I realised when this happened it was because of stress which made it way better and I rarely get those flare ups anymore, so that's cool.

Last month I was under a lot of stress and for some days I started feeling light-headed and a bit dizzy. The best way to describe this would be:

- Slightly out-of-mind 
- I feel like my cognitive capabilities are at 90-95% of the usual
- Cloudy head, like what I would experience being slightly drunk (not a lot)

I went to the doctor really worried and got a blood test and stuff and they said I was healthy and probably was stress.

But the thing is it's been a month like this already, sometimes I feel great (although not as a month ago), specially when doing stuff that makes me forget about this (ie videogames, series...) others I feel like shit, does anyone experience something similar and if so any recommendations?

I'm also a bit worried because the first day I really experienced this I did a pretty intense session of cardio (had been doing a lot during those weeks on top of the stress from uni) so I am slightly worried it is actually something "body" related even if the tests came out okay, going for chill walks doesn't seem to be helping probably because I'm overthinking this all the time.

Thanks

Hello,

I´ve been struggling with stress for a while now and I have tried many things. Some things work for a while others not so much.

Content:
Hi guys, I am looking for some advice. I am going to tell my employer tomorrow that I want out and it terrifies me given the fact that the entire project depends on me. I cannot take the stress that comes with the job anymore, and my boss is very aggressive so telling him I resign is going to be very toxic. I don’t have the guts to tell him for some time but I sent my resignation email already. I am super scared, I will be definitely shout at and treated aggressively and I just want some advice on how to deal with this mentally? I already got sick (diarrhea, fever) because of the stress. I have to work 14 hours a day because of this project and I also burned out already I am super exhausted and I can’t tale it anymore.

Does anybody feel scared when resigning?

Post 308: I hate school with all of my heart and sole
Content:
I’m in math 10c rn which is the most advanced math that you can take for grade ten. Hs starts in grade 10 for most Canadian schools. Last years they drilled it into our heads that if we didn’t graduate hs with good grades in dash one classes then we would be failures. I know that’s not true but when you have that notion slapped in your face every day for a whole school year, your gut, sole, mind, and body will believe it even if you don’t. 

I literally can’t with my math class. I have a 10% rn and I’m so behind. I don’t understand anything. I can’t eat or sleep, I’m breaking out in rashes and nose bleeds and I experience s***idal thoughts every day bc of math. Well other things in my life do impact me like this do but math 100% plays a role. I know in my heart that I need to drop to dash three but then that would be all kinds of stressful in a different way bc all of my friends are in dash one and I would feel like a failure and I would feel like I haven’t tried as hard as I possibly could. I feel like I would regret it forever. 

Things I think I may want to do after I graduate: 
-kms
-be a flight attendant 
-be a pilot 
-be an engineer 
-go into science 
-fine arts especially musical theatre 
-acting

Post 310: Went from normal to crippled
Content:
I’ve always been able to take everything in stride. Handling stressful situations is my specialty actually. My job is absurdly stressful and I’ve climbed the ranks by being able to deal with it all. 

Until, out of no where, I got blindsided about a month ago by constant exhaustion, anxiety and panic. Suddenly, I’m so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open. I have to step out of meetings to literally lay on my office floor and rest. Many work situations that used to be no big deal make my heart race and make me short of breath. I never expected this would happen to me. 

It’s scary. Tons of stressful stuff has been coming at me for months and I think it just finally hit me all at once. And I’m worried this is the way I’ll feel forever. 

I’m focusing on healthy self care and taking a week off soon just to rest my body and nerves. I’m also meeting with a therapist soon. Praying to god that “this too shall pass” applies to my situation. Honestly, this is just nuts.

Content:
I’m just so tired, and it’s over the dumbest things. I should be thankful, right? I just got a new job. A job I’ve wanted for a while. But, when I get there I feel the anxiety start to flare up. The fast pace wears me out. Trying to keep up appearances is exhausting. My apartment is my safe haven, but still there all the chores wait for me. I got a new kitten. He’s supposed to be my emotional support. Instead, he makes the stress worst. Scratching, terrorizing. My bf is supposed to help take the stress away. Instead I worry I complain too much. I’m not holding it together like I should. He’ll leave when he realizes he much trouble I really am. Why is everything so hard? Why is there no peace?

Post 313: This is one of the adverse causes of stress, leading to premature aging.
Content:
 

Under the overwhelming responsibilities and being in the rush in the fast-growing modern world, stress is sometimes unavoidable. Hence, the cases of inflammation increase in clinical papers. When the stress becomes chronic and uncontrollable it can be a detriment for the body. These long-term stresses are linked to chronic inflammations.

When the body is under the condition of stress the organism goes through fight-and-flight responses. This is the body’s reaction to some harmful attacks for its survival. During this process cortisol- a stress hormone is released. Cortisol suppresses digestion and accurate immune response to stress. It sends signals to the brain that affects [**mood, motivation, and fear**](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037#:~:text=Adrenaline%20increases%20your%20heart%20rate,of%20substances%20that%20repair%20tissues.).

Cortisol causes excess production of glucose (blood sugar), prevents the production of insulin, and narrows the arteries. This is the reason why the blood starts pumping harder under the stress. Adrenalin is another hormone that causes increased heart and respiratory rate also causes blood pressure.

When the body is under constant stress flight-or-fight responses are always present. Consequently, when the stress responses are always on and the hormones constantly restrict the body’s natural processes many diseases such as anxiety, depression, metabolic disorders, and obesity can come forth. Stresses can also be aggravators for multiple sclerosis. There are [**studies**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115807/), linking the stressful lifestyle and the exacerbation of the diseases.

Another major cause of inflammation can be oxidative stress. This is the excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also known as free radicals in the body’s cells and tissues. And the insufficiency of antioxidants (fighters against free radicals) can be extremely harmful to cellular molecules, cause DNA damage, proteins.

The balanced amount of ROS is considered to be even profitable for the body being involved in the cell homeostasis and functions such as gene expression and activation of [**receptors.**](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC5055983&blobtype=pdf)

Several factors and lifestyles can bring to oxidative stress. Unrestrained and extreme amounts of exercise, smoking and drug misuse, fatty, processed, and refined food, and even untreated injuries or traumas are major causes of oxidative stress.

The production of an excessive amount of ROS in the body can lead to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines (regulators of inflammatory reactions). There is a line of evidence from [**studies**](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2013/963520/), that oxidative stress plays a pathogenic role in chronic inflammatory diseases.

Generated ROS in brain tissues can lead to neuroinflammation and cell death later causing neurodegenerative diseases and memory loss.  


Chronic inflammation is a serious case and has a significant link to aging and longevity. Healthy life management and a conscious lifestyle can increasingly decrease the possibility of any type of inflammations and enhance longevity.

Post 315: Relaxing doesn't help...at all
Content:
I stress about anything and everything, and I have physical symptoms such as increased earwax and even periods while on a birth control where I had no periods. There are others but I can't remember them. But my stress piles and piles on me, some of which even my therapist agrees I can't do anything about because the reasons are unavoidable. If the cause is fixed it goes away, but you can't get rid of all stressors....I've tried.

I do know how to relax, I even have mental health days where I focus on having fun and I don't do anything else.

But relaxing, having fun, taking care of myself mentally and such don't actually reduce stress for me. My therapist seemed genuinely surprised and a bit confused, but couldn't offer much help. They are helping me in other ways so I don't want to try to find someone else.

Anyone else have this problem or have suggestions? I plan to try yoga but I have physical issues and have a hard time keeping something going more than a couple months when it comes to exercise anyways.

Is there anything besides fun to relax? I can reduce my anxiety, I've been working on my depression and it's bad habits. I just can't think of what else to do, as far as I know there really isn't anything. Fun and relaxation are supposed to reduce stress, and it doesn't. Am I just screwed? I'm pretty sure I already know the answer.

Thanks for reading if you have.

Post 316: I quit my gas station job on the spot
Content:
Hi everyone I was working on a gas station during the summer and I just wanted to tell someone my frustrations. My employer knew I had plans to return to school this 6th of june. I provided my school schedule so she was able to see I am being truthful. I did this a month in advance and I help her to get a replacement for the other 20 hours I wasn't going to work. The week I return to school she didn't change my schedule and i confronted her and she said that she can't change the schedule. I was understanding and I suck it up and fuck my sleep because I knew she was having a hard time. I just tell her that next week I better get my schedule right and she said that I am good employee and wanted to make me assistant manager because everyone in this place have the IQ of someone who is brain damage. Therefore, she went on telling me that she didn't want me to quit. Guess what she fuck my schedule I was pretty clear no more than 20 hours ( two 10 hours shift thats how we did it)
And to top it all I worked 11:00 PM- 7:00AM (Graveyard shift) and she wanted me to come back at 3:00 PM. It would have been miserable but nothing crazy but also I had class at 9:30- 12:30. I wasn't able to take it anymore she got to the store I ask her if she knew I had to go to school and I would not be able to sleep and go to work. She only said "oh I am sorry this girl cannot cover you because she can't (background she is referring to a girl that doesn't go to school, no kids, doesn't work full time because she has to be supervised because she is kinda dump and always come short on the register) I clock off and leave a text message that I won't come back.

Post 318: I’m worried I’m going to disappoint my family
Content:
I don’t really know where to turn and I’m running out of options. I’m in Med school, abroad, and am embroiled in trying to earn a few more points on a major exam so that I can attend my sister’s wedding, which is to be held in the States. The exam I failed has a make up, but it is literally scheduled the day after the wedding, so to travel back abroad still means I would have to miss out on the occasion, which itself can’t be delayed any further. I know that I am not the strongest of students, but I really felt confident with the particular exam, and now because of my own damn fault I may be withheld from going. I just feel like I’m letting everyone down, like I’m just destined to keep failing. It’s hard to talk to people close to me on this matter, despite me doing so, because it just goes back into this loop of “you did this to yourself, you need to dedicate more time to studying, etc.” I don’t disagree with the feedback, but it’s not helping me right now. I just feel trapped.

Update: well, I tried. I went to the University office, and it was such a farce. They stopped any conversation saying “Their hands are tied,” or “we are legally bound from doing ...”, including providing the answer key to said exam so that I could see where the points were lost. I won’t be attending my sister’s wedding, and will have to sit in for the make up exam. I never minded sitting for the exam, it’s just the timing of it all. I could go on about how pathetic the scheduling system is, how I can’t even access the exam admit card until a few days prior to the exam, but it’s not going to do me any good. Wish me luck on this exam please. You’ve all been very kind. As for my family, of course they are understanding of the situation. I just feel horrible letting them down.

Post 320: Being in nature reduces stress and blood pressure - but crucially also stops us ruminating on the past and future
Content:
Spending time in nature makes a huge difference to our mental health; research has shown it can decrease our stress levels, reduce our heart rate and reduce our blood pressure - but one of the most interesting effects it has is to reduce how much we ruminate, how much we attach ourselves to our thoughts.

When we get swept away by our thoughts and lose touch with the present moment, suffering isn’t far behind. Being lost in the past and future drives a great deal of our sadness and anxiety. Where nature is incredibly powerful is in its ability to focus our attention, taking us out of our heads and into our surroundings via our senses.

And aside from all that, it takes us away from the information bombardment for a little while, away from our work and our phone and the TV. So when we give our full attention to a bird that's landed on a tree or take the time to look at the different parts of a flower we’re giving a minds a break and bringing ourselves back to the only place we can be happy - here and now.

Post 321: Energy can be locked in the body in many different ways. It can be locked in on a mental, physical, emotional, spiritual level, or in any combination of these levels.
Content:

On a physical level, the body absorbs and retains chemicals and unresolved emotions in the cells, muscles, bones and organs. On a mental and emotional level, there are times when memories and emotions which were either suppressed or forgotten are re-experienced and remembered as an individual is receiving a healing. 

If you accept that the body, mind and spirit of a person are always seeking a return to wholeness, it is easier to understand how your own healing Spiritual energy can assist you in triggering and releasing these blockages. 

Your spiritual energy goes under many different names like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more.

This energy provided in a healing session can release trauma locked in the body from accidents, abuse, fear, or loss of a family member or pet.

Consciously manipulating your own Spiritual chills to heal has tremendous benefits for your astral body, physical health and much more.

If you are interested, techniques outlined in this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/P1A6fpKaMCA) can help you get in touch with your spiritual power to unblock these energies.

Post 322: How to take life less seriously
Content:
Hi all, I (24 M) am new to this sub but I think I am in the right place for this post.

Basically, I have had an absolute shit year. Last June, I lost my father suddenly to an overdose. We didn't know this at the time - we only found out months later and it came as a shock because we had no idea he even had a drug problem to begin with. Anyway, his death caused a massive ripple effect in our family and being his oldest son I have had to step into some big shoes. I found myself caught in between drama involving my dad's mom and my own mom, while also having to be there for my younger brother (19). My parents owned a restaurant and following my dad's death the building landlord forced us out because he wanted the building for himself. So after learning the results of the toxicology report, we had to scramble to close the restaurant down and get out of the building before the landlord tried suing us again. To help my mom with the restaurant closing I had to leave my job (which I hated anyway) and now I am applying to dental school (another very involved and stressful process) while looking for a new job.

Long story short, I just feel like there are a lot of people depending on me all the time now and it feels like a lot of pressure. I constantly feel as though I am behind the eight ball and with each passing day I get more and more stressed out. I am just worried that if I can't handle this type of pressure now, how will I juggle a career and a family of my own on top of all this.

I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to stay in the moment and take life less seriously and enjoy it. I find myself putting so much pressure on every decision I make and it ends up stressing me out to the point where I am miserable to be around.

I've been pretty stressed out for about 10 months, since the last 2 weeks i've had more on my plate than a spinster at a wedding and I constantly feel stomach pains, hunger and kind of nauseous. 

I'll admit that i'm not eating regularly, i'm skipping meals often and not eating well. However this is pretty normal for me, and yet even immediately after eating, I feel hungry, it's awful. I know I'm handling my emotional health badly so I'm looking for advice on how to tackle this from that end, obviously i'll get back to healthier eating habits too.

I guess this is a vent of sorts. I just feel the need to express just how stressed out I get the day before my next shift starts. It’s early a.m. and I should have been asleep hours ago but I’m stressing.

I want more than anything to move back home but I’m stuck and that only adds to the stress.

Post 326: Ways to Get Out of Stress
Content:
I really don't know about you, but I frequently find advice to discharge tension and stress to be good on paper but unbelievably tough to apply.

&#x200B;

Simply say no more frequently! Sounds great, but my twenty-month-old son needs continuous care and I want to get cash, so there is a lot I can not simply not conduct .

&#x200B;

I really do try, but it has been chilly and gray, and I do not get myself until nighttime --if it is even more freezing.

&#x200B;

I've the very best of intentions, however I am pregnant, often exhausted, and there is that whole time .

&#x200B;

I assume this is the case of most good information: It is much easier to make a record of good thoughts than it is to really apply them. And it is difficult not to withstand all those well-intentioned tips as too simplified and possibly even unrealistic.

&#x200B;

That, I have understood, is my main issue --one which you can connect to as well: While my situation can be hard and restricting, the majority of the strain and tension I believe originates with some type of inner resistance. Resistance to what's, what's, what could be, what I am doing, what I might do, who I'm... the list continues.

&#x200B;

And It May seem like this:

&#x200B;

If you have done one of these things yourself, then I am certain that you know they are exhausting.

&#x200B;

That isn't say we're the only cause of our anxiety.

&#x200B;

And it is correct there are a lot of small things we can do to alleviate some of the strain. Nevertheless, the very first thing we have to do is ease the pressure at which it is generally the most extreme: inside our own minds.

&#x200B;

The Way to Relieve the Emotional Pressure

There are just two things I have found to be extremely effective in quieting my internal voice of immunity.

&#x200B;

1. Let yourself feel the feelings below your ideas so you can calm and discharge them.

Too often we get caught in a notion loop for a means to avoid feeling our feelings, as stressful as it could be, considering our situation permits us to avoid confronting our deepest consequences. However, we must confront them to cure them. As they state, the only real way out is through.

&#x200B;

I have discovered that under my changing kinds of inner resistance, there is generally:

&#x200B;

And this causes my heart youth wounds which led me to think I am basically bad.

&#x200B;

Once I believe it

When I am rehashing the past, judging myself compared to other people, and debilitating about what folks think of me personally.

&#x200B;

Stress:

Yet more, this activates my childhood wounds which led me to think I am not great enough, and never will be.

&#x200B;

Once I believe it

When I am residing on worst-case situations, stressing about what I need to do, and worry about what I ought to do.

&#x200B;

Toward myself to get what I believe I did wrong, toward others for the way I believe they did me toward for myself to get possibly inducing them to do wrong (since I frequently find a way to blame myself), toward lifestyle for being unjust. This activates my core belief that existence ought to be honest, shaped, you guessed it, in youth, when life felt really unjust.

&#x200B;

Once I believe it

When I am rehashing the past and battling my existing reality.

&#x200B;

Once I believe it

When I will get under the ideas and identify among those feelings, I will sit with this. I am able to shout out it --the ultimate launch!

&#x200B;

I am able to empathize with myself and inform me what I want to hear--which I am a fantastic person who is always done her best, I shall do my best in the long run and can handle what is coming, that everybody else is doing their best, and most of us deserve forgiveness and understanding.

&#x200B;

Perhaps take a hot bath if I am feeling embarrassed to remind myself that I deserve relaxation even when I believe I have messed up.

&#x200B;

Perhaps write a forgiveness letter when I am feeling mad to assist me empathize, take, and go ahead.

&#x200B;

Maybe call somebody I adore, diary, or do something creative when I am feeling empty, to fulfill my need for relationship.

&#x200B;

The purpose is, once we believe our feelingswe could do something to cover the particular root cause of our anxiety at a minute rather than arbitrarily selecting an action from a one-size-fits-all collection of stress-relievers.

&#x200B;

What is the feeling beneath it? What exactly does that feeling need to instruct me? What exactly does it need to listen? And what do I do to help alleviate this pain?

&#x200B;

2. Take out of your mind (and possibly into your entire body or a condition of circulation ).

It is ironic but true that two bits of apparently contradictory information can be both beneficial and strong, and this really is true when it comes to alleviating stress. Or at least it's been for me personally.

&#x200B;

On the 1 hand, it may help us to look carefully at what is happening in our heads so we are able to know it, question it if necessary, and calm the feelings under our ideas.

&#x200B;

On the flip side, sometimes we just must disengage from our thoughts tales --our unfulfilling workour mounting billsour insensitive relatives, etc. To recognize we are getting caught up in a psychological maze where we might never escape unless we knowingly decide to escape and then make this selection.

&#x200B;

Our mind's default style system (DMN), that is intended to protect ustends toward negativity, frequently concentrated on the past, the future, as well as the intentions behind the others' behaviour. Studies have demonstrated a connection between a active DMN and melancholy and anxiety--also has additionally demonstrated that meditation might help affect the default system.

&#x200B;

That is why it's important that we know to escape our minds, either via conventional meditation or simply by getting into our own bodies or a condition of stream (when you are so absorbed at a job which you forget about everything else and eliminate track of time).

&#x200B;

Mindfulness can actually change patterns of brain activity with time, allowing us to frequently escape the default style system --at which we unavoidably feel stressed!

&#x200B;

How can we get from our heads and to our own bodies or a country of stream?

&#x200B;

When you sync your breath with your movements and focus your attention on the delicate muscle changes necessary to enter and maintain each pose, you will discover your mind obviously quieting. There are tons of different varieties of yoga.

&#x200B;

You may discover all sorts of yoga videos on YouTube, and chances are, even if life gets nearer to normal , it is possible to locate a free or donation-based class around you. Personally, I find it less difficult to exercise in a course than in my, because the existence of different folks holds me accountable, and you will find fewer biscuits and TVs nearby to divert me!

&#x200B;

Acting requires you to escape your judging head, and Tai Chi is the ideal clinic to ease that, as it is about integrating body and mind through slow, low-impact, controlled breathing and movements.

&#x200B;

Tai chi is significantly less physically taxing than many yoga practices (besides restorative yoga, which can be exceptionally relaxing), making it ideal for anybody who is more emotionally restricted. It is especially popular with the senior audience, as it is easy on the joints, but it is a strong and effectual mindfulness practice for anybody, of any age!

&#x200B;

# Mindful trekking or walking

Any type of movement could be meditative in case you concentrate your attention on the sensations in our bodies, and trekking and walking out attract the additional advantage of immersing you into character --a pure stress-reliever!

&#x200B;

Various studies have revealed that only twenty minutes in character can considerably decrease your stress hormones. And in addition, it can excite all of the body's senses, as we listen into the noise of running water trickling nearby, the odor of pine (proven to reduce depression and stress ), the colours in a scenic sunrise, the sensation of leaves crunching under our feet, and the flavor of a freshly selected bit of fruit.

&#x200B;

Through social causes

We frequently consider stream as something we reach separately, but group actions bring the extra advantage of easing deep link as we proceed in sync or work toward group objectives. This may mean becoming a collective state of stream as part of a sports group, dancing troupe, or via synchronized swimmingpool.

&#x200B;

I recall one specific bit of choreography out of a neighborhood theatre show I did as a child. There were twenty of us, seated, performing clapping moves with one another's hands, patting on our own and each other's thighs. All of us had to move perfectly in sync to get it just right, which demanded intense attention, and I must say it was profoundly satisfying to maneuver within a complete --to lose myself into the group and also be immersed in something larger than myself.

&#x200B;

Through imaginative triggers

Any creative action can get us into a condition of stream if we like it and lose ourselves at the endeavor. Painting, playing an instrument, dance, jewelry manufacturing, much doodling--select whatever calls for you so deeply you can not help but focus on the gift, losing your sense of self-consciousness since the action itself is so enjoyable and rewarding.

&#x200B;

Through ecological triggers

Rock climbing is the perfect example, as you have to be completely absorbed in the moment to safely browse the stone formation.

&#x200B;

Although I have never achieved outside rock climbing--that I imagine is even more thrilling, as it is riskier and you are totally immersed in character --I engaged in a climbing class as a experiential therapy treatment for bulimia in my early twenties. I recall all my worries falling apart as I concentrated on not falling off the beam, and that I remember enjoying my body to get what it might do rather than judging myself for what I believed I had been doing wrong.

&#x200B;

You are able to take an hour course or merely exercise for ten minutes. It's possible to work on a painting for 2 hours or sketch to get a short window .

&#x200B;

Obviously! It is far simpler to watch Netflix within our free hour of time or scroll in that short window . While I do this, all of my thick unfelt feelings fester, settling deep in to my mind and my bones and hammering me like an imperceptible straitjacket.

&#x200B;

However, I understand when I do something which's very good for me personally, I think itand I need it. Along with my resistance to doing this obviously fades away, together with my anxiety.

&#x200B;

So actually, we simply have to appear after --actually appear. Be present we allow us to completely live that moment so we are able to appreciate that instant, which love will bring us back. Back to the clinic, back to our own bodies back to ourselves. Our deepest Truth, under the strain and pressure. The authentic self who knows we do not have to be more, we still do not need to perform longer, we only need to let's like more. Because within that pleasure there is peace and recovery. And regardless of what our negatively biased brains inform uswe totally deserve it.

Post 327: I need some advice for being a better bf for my gf who is going through a lot of mental health problems right now.
Content:
&#x200B;

I have been with this girl for 4 months and we are both the age of 20 in college. Our relationship has been amazing before the past couple of weeks. I am really close to losing her because I am just not good at being emotional support for her.

Since school started in February, she works part time 25 hours a week while taking 19 credits as a STEM major, and contributes to a sorority. She has no time for anything and has just been so overwhelmed. She gets about 4 hours of sleep a night and is falling behind in her classes. Every night she has panic attacks and is just so insanely stressed and a lot of the times she says she can't do life and says she is going to kill herself.

Our relationship is semi-long distance. I am able to visit her every other week and be able to spend time with her for 6 days. I feel I am a lot better at being emotional support for her in person rather than over text or over the phone. She tells me that I am making it harder for her mentally because I am just really bad at talking her through it. She also says that I give her more stress because when I talk to her I make her feel bad that she is behind in her classes. Our relationship is on thin ice and she keeps telling me that we are not going to make it. I potentially have Covid so I will not be able to see her for a while. I am just looking for some advice on how to talk to her.

I am in love with this girl and I just always see past the mentally hurt girl. When she is mentally healthy she is just the sweetest, funniest, appreciative and loving girl. We have a lot of potential in our future and I really don't want to lose that. Does anyone have some good advice or links for how to talk to someone who is insanely stressed and depressed?

Content:
(16 F) i’ve never knew how stressed out i was with everything. two days ago i had a mental breakdown at work. i remember hanging clothes on the sales floor and having suicidal thoughts. i remember not being able to breathe, so i quickly ran to the restroom and broke down in tears. i started banging on the sink out of frustration and anger. I haven’t been diagnosed yet, but if the doctor told me i had depression, anxiety, and bipolar depression. i don’t think i would be surprised. my manager came in the restroom and asked me what was wrong but i couldn’t get it out. this is my a millionth time crying at work. just last week i congratulated myself for not calling out sick when i was really just depressed. i told her she should leave and not to worry about what’s wrong with me because i’m use to constantly crying. i then leave the restroom and ran to my car without clocking out. my crying became even louder and i started banging on the steering wheel while screaming. i just don’t know what to do anymore. ever since that day i’ve been thinking about going to do things such as getting my nose pierced, but lord knows how my african parents would take that.(at a point when i don’t even care anymore and do what makes me happy. they already weren’t happy when i first got my hair locked up.) when i came home later that day my mom asked me why was i crying at work. of course i couldn’t tell her because african parents never take this type of shit serious, so i shrugged it off. (my school called my mom back in january about my suicide attempt, and she was pissed off about it. she told me not to tell them that next time.) it’s been so many fucked up shit to happen to me within just one time frame this year, but i mean everyone had a bad year this year.

Post 333: My Relationship is killing me. I have searched for answers everywhere.
Content:
Hi, I (m36) am currently in a long distance relationship. I love this woman but she has a severe drinking problem that she is trying to keep secret from me. 

The reason I know this is because her roommate has secretly been feeding me information about this. The fact that I know someone who I love is outright lying to me makes me extremely anxious. So much to the fact that I was forced to take medication to relieve my anxiety. 

My question is do I end the relationship with the woman I love to save my health.  Ending the relationship require me I to throw the roommate under the bus because how else would she know I have this information. 3 lives would be effected if I did this. I would feel the worst about betraying the roommate who I know he doesn’t have many friends. This action would surely end their relationship.

Please help this is killing me. The anxiety is killing my as I am writing this. 😢 . No lie it brings me to tears.

Post 337: The 3 types of stress reduction techniques and how they work.
Content:
**So, what causes you stress?**

What a funny question! You might say, I should rather be asking you what does not cause you stress. While everything under the sky seems to have the power to cause you stress, what could you possibly do to counter it? Do you have any ability at all to fight back or is the war hopelessly lost without a shot.

Let me equip you with some stress reduction techniques which will help you in your war against stress.

**So, What are the main types of stress management techniques?**

The 3 main types of stress reduction techniques are:

1. Cognitive techniques which try to train your mind and redirect your thoughts such as mindfulness, meditation and visualisation.

2. Relaxation techniques which try to appeal to your soul — like connecting with your family and friends, or indulging in your favorite hobbies

3. Physical techniques which work around your body such as physical exercise, Yoga or breathing techniques.

**How exactly do these stress management techniques work?**

Let me delve into each of these stress management techniques to see how they work so you are fully prepared with your arsenal of tools to win the familiar battle next time around.

**1.Cognitive techniques:**

Exercises on mindfulness, meditation and visualisation help due to the fact that they arrest the chain of negative thoughts and imaginations that further exacerbate stress. Stress causing thoughts often associated with negative emotions such as fear, anger, worry, jealousy etc.. gain strength only when the mind continues fueling them with more emotionalised thoughts. These thoughts develop into gigantic spiraling waves inside our head, directly leading to stress and anxiety. The moment you are able to calm your mind and stop fueling more thoughts, the spiral waves lose momentum and fall flat to the ground. These stress reducing exercises such as mindfulness, meditation and visualisation all train the mind to stop feeding this tornado of thoughts. However, they do need patient practice over time before you start seeing results.

**2. Relaxation techniques:**

Connecting with your loved ones or indulging in your favourite pass time, is a simple method to disengage and re-balance your mind. By doing so, you are reminding yourself that there are other more important or enjoyable matters that you can use to fill your mind space. This often results in decluttering your mind and in gaining a much needed clarity of thought. Not only is stress and anxiety reduced as a direct outcome due to such a mental shift, but also, often times, a new perspective or solution is obtained as an indirect outcome. Hence the importance of a healthy work life balance cannot be stressed enough.

**3. Physical techniques:**

*“I am too stressed to workout today”*

*“I am too busy to practise Yoga or breathing today”*

*“I am too tired to go play football tonight”*

Sounds familiar? How often do you say these to yourself? By giving yourself an excuse, you are actually throwing away a golden opportunity to counter stress. You are forgetting that your body has a wonderful and powerful influence over your mind. By doing that physical exercise you can elevate your mind to go above stress inducing thoughts. Use this to your fullest advantage and let exactly those reasons of being too stressed, too busy or too tired, drive you to go do your exercise. The awesome after-effects of self-confidence and accomplishment usually always shatters that stress to pieces!

Post 341: How I Learned to Control my Migraines
Content:
Hey guys, I thought I'd share my story of dealing with migraines. I used to start getting them for what I thought was absolutely no reason. I was always an anxious person, but when I started my first job after college, I started getting these stress migraines, and they were debilitating. I would come home from work and just lie down for hours until I fell asleep, only to wake up with the pain the next day.

The underlying cause was stress, and I would experience other bodily manifestations of my stress such as bloating, excessive sweating, and sleep issues. As you can imagine, my body was a wreck. While I still experience these feelings from time to time, I have them significantly more under control and rarely get these uncomfortable feelings. Here's how I was able to take care of them.

First and foremost, while I did meditate and it did help, I realized the underlying cause was that I wasn't focusing on the task in front of me, and was instead trying to multitask. When you try and multitask, you cause anxiety. Anxiety is "being here but wanting to be there." This would take a toll on my mental energy. Once I stopped trying to multitask and focus only on the task at hand, my migraines started to become less frequent. Meditation helps with this because you are asked to practice concentration.

Next, when I experienced these feelings, I approached them with a sense of curiosity. Why was my body reacting this way? Instead of getting upset at our body, like most of us do when we get these feelings, I started listening to my body. I realized that stress and anxiety are trying to tell me something. These emotions are my ally as opposed to my enemy.

I came up with a great analogy as to why I was getting these migraines. When you consistently put unhealthy food inside your body, what happens? You get a stomach ache. When you consistently put unhealthy thoughts inside your mind, you get a mind-ache, or a migraine! Once I came up with that analogy, I was more mindful of what thoughts I was letting inside of my mind. You'll be surprised with the kind of garbage you let inside of your mind. That's what these feelings are telling you, so becoming curious about them really helped.

By this point, I was experiencing the physical manifestations of stress a lot less frequently, but I was still experiencing them. This brings me to my final point. Trust and believe in the process. These won't disappear overnight. However, if you noticed changed up until now (which I did), I trusted the process, and eventually, I almost virtually eliminated them.

I hope that helps those of you who are suffering from stress-related migraines. I tried to keep this as short and digestible as possible, so I left out a lot of detail. But please comment or PM me if you want me to expand on anything further. I know how much these suck, so I'm happy to help out further if I can.

Post 343: School stress
Content:
I know that this might not mean much to you but i'll post it anyways;

Online school hasn't changed much as going to school. Feeling overwhelmed with loads of homework and assignments. All of my assignments are late due 3 months. Teachers calling my parents. Barely have any motivation, energy to do anything. I don't want to do anything except sleep eternally. I sometimes cry out of frustration because i can't do my school work.  Everyday is like the same routine nothing changes. Constant reminder of wanting to die. I honestly think i'm pathetic. I pity myself for wanting to die just because i cant do some work. At this point i just think im overreacting and pretending to be stressed/depressed.

Edit 1: just want to add some things.

Post 344: Struggling to not breakdown
Content:
*Update*

Id like to thank everyone for the kind love and support and good advice ive gotten. 

Things have been getting , if not better ,but more manageable.  My work has managed to hire more staff and while our influx of orders keeps going up it helps to have the extra staff around.

Family stuff has been managed for the most part and while I'm still vehicleless I'm making moves to get that taken care of. 

So in short, the stress has still been severe but not in the same way that it was before. 

*update end*

Ever since the stay at home orders in my state happened (I'm from Oklahoma) and my mental health has kinda been all over the place. 

I work in a grocery store as an online shopper and as you could guess our workload has exploded from getting 20 - 30 orders a day to nearly 70 - 80 orders a day. With our limited supplies , limited trained staff and limited equipment to shop orders I've been struggling to stay put together at work.

At home things are rougher. I live with my dad , his fiancee, her son and my younger brother. This past week my step-brother was attacked by his dog and had to go the ER for medical help. 

My grandfather, who lives in California , had to have emergency gallbladder and intestinal surgery this past week and on top of everything else my car was hit by a drunk driver and now I only have a few days to try and find a new vehicle before I gave to go back to work. 

I work Sat - wed so ive been holding it together through the work week but every Thursday since march ive been stuck in bed nearly bawling my eyes out about everything thats happening. 

Its just feels like too much .

Post 345: An epiphany I’ve had regarding our inherent potential...
Content:
I believe in the body’s inherent potential to heal itself.  

This in no way diminishes the need for excellent medical care, which we are thankfully so blessed to have.  

I see this healing truth in every patient I treat in my physical therapy manual therapy practice and it brings me great peace to remember the incredible design in which we are created, and the Herculean feats our bodies accomplish behind the scenes, every day.  

I believe in this power of positive thinking, and how powerful our thoughts are to our health.  

I believe this is a necessary aspect of creating a personal environment of serenity and calm for ourselves, to thus allow us to be of support and of service to others.  Wishing you and your loved ones much blessing and peace ☮️🎹☮️

Post 346: How do you deal with muscle tension
Content:
Hi Everyone,

To give some quick context, I work a 830-5 desk job with an hour+ commute both ways. As a result i experience very bad muscle tension, especially in my neck, shoulders and lower back but throughout the rest of my body also.

Is there anything I can do to get rid of the tension? I work out 3-4  days a week ( run, then do some core/shoulder/back exercises). 

TIA!

Post 347: I need some advice in my life.
Content:
For a while now, My mother and my stepfather in my opinion are just not happy with their marriage and it shows in the past few year that I have lived with them. I'm 17 years old and in a couple of months will turn 18 and I'm about to graduate High School and will be attending HCC while living with my troubled parents. 
They rarely spend any time with any each other. Sleep in separate rooms; In addition, almost every Thursday night almost quarrel with each other, which includes: Explicit terms, The silent treatment, Ad Hominem's, and to put icing on the cake, it almost always ends up with yelling which can heard throughout the whole house. 
I've gotten to a point where I'm just tired of it all. I'm tired of the constant stress of having to worry about what time either one gets home, so I can tune the awful noise with my headphones; cranked up to near full volume. I love both of them and always will, but its to the point where I just don't feel like its worth the money of staying with them for 2 more years while I attend my local Community College in order to save money. 
Anyone who can provide me with good advice on how I should deal with my overall stress is appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Post 349: Planning trips stresses me out so much because there are too many variables. Any advice?
Content:
* I have to decide how many vacation days I can take off and predict how many I will need to save for the rest of the year
 * "Can I get away with flying after a day of work?"  Probably not
 * "Can I get away with arriving home really early and going to work the same day?"  Didn't work last time, I had to take a sick day to recover from the redeye.
* I have to pick a flight, possibly starting and ending at different airports
 * There are multiple airports near me to choose from
 * Sometimes I also have the option of arriving at one place and leaving from a different place to come home
 * So many cost vs convenience trade-offs
* I have to figure out how I'm going to get to (each) airport and whether the cost increase of one thing nullifies the cost savings of the other
 * Lyft/Uber? ($$ and a little sketchy)
 * Public transportation (cheap but slow, inconvenient and several steps to plan and how do I get to train station)
 * Drive myself and park ($$$ but convenient)
 * Ask a friend (I don't have many friends I would feel comfortable asking, and their schedules probably don't align anyway)
* I have to coordinate with multiple other people at the destination and figure out when their schedules will align with mine
 * which they may not know yet
 * or may recursively depend on my schedule
* The longer I wait to buy tickets, the more sure I am of other people's plans
* The longer I wait to buy tickets, the more they cost and the fewer options there are

There are so many variables and trade-offs between them and I just get super stressed out and shut down, procrastinating until only bad options are left.  

Change my perspective?  Or give me tools to help deal with it?  I can afford to make some of these problems go away by throwing money at them, which is nice, but I'm not rich enough to just choose the most convenient option.

(Then the traveling itself stresses me out, too, yay.  Constantly anxious that I will miss some link in the chain and ruin everything.)

Post 350: Chronic stress/anxiety and the aftermath of its related issues.
Content:
So long story short, on the outside I have the seemingly “perfect” life: 31yo female with no remarkable health issues, a thriving career making a decent living, a happy and healthy young daughter, in a long term relationship with a man who loves me (my daughters father) a beautiful home, nice car, no real financial troubles (aside from overspending/undersaving).... however, I have been dealing with major, chronic stress/anxiety for about a year now stemming mostly from my relationship (75% stepchildren related) and now my job (because I am unable to resolve this stress). I have always had anxiety issues, so I have been an evening marijuana user for approx. 8 years to wind down and help me sleep. This stress has recently turned into depression ~9 months ago when my stepdaughter was alienated from us, “because of me”. It was then I started to notice new, troubling acute and intermittent symptoms, like brain fog, poor concentration, NO libido, inability to relay thoughts consistently and effectively, extreme fatigue, no appetite, no strength, high BP/racing heart, weakness, to name a few. 4 days ago, I experienced what I believed to be a mini stroke - although I was “alert”, I felt very disoriented, couldn’t talk normally, felt confused, off balance, numbness in hands, felt like I was gliding rather than walking. After a couple of hours, I eventually went to urgent care to get my symptoms reviewed, as I simply just did not want to commit myself to ED if it was not 100% necessary (I know that wasn’t the best option in that moment, however I felt for me it was.) Neuro exam review was “fine” they said, and she said I likely had an inner ear infection, and gave me Antivert and said to follow up with PCP. Me knowing my history, I was not sold on that diagnosis, but felt fine enough to accept it. Today I followed up with my PCP whom I’ve been with for 10 years. She agreed that it likely wasnt an inner ear infection due to lack of symptoms, so I have an MRI ordered and will be going tomorrow. 

I actually work in the medical field, specifically mental health and addiction, so I am very well aware that my stress/anxiety/depression/MJ use are likely the reason for my issues. I am concerned about the damage my body has endured with this stroke-like incident. Has this stress simply turned my otherwise healthy body over for good? 

I know without a doubt all of these issues have put me where I am today. A few weeks ago (prior to the “stroke” incident), I was certain I had MS due to all my progressive symptoms, yet knowing deep down the real, most likely culprits that would need to cease before going to major diagnosis like that, but the only missing symptom was a stroke- then bam! That happens. 

I have not used MJ for 4 days (I’m fine without it), but the relationship and kid stress is something that will not stop or go away. Basically I’ve decided to finally move out to get away from the stress I cannot control, and I’m hoping that will save my life. Work related stress I used to handle like a champ, but now I’m falling behind at work and unable to catch up. If things keep going this way, I will eventually lose my job; or worse, my life as this constant fight or flight is slowly killing me. My mood is just emotionless. At this point, I’m simply in survival mode which has essentially ruined/ended my relationship. I realize I must make some major lifestyle changes, I am just hoping to hear that these issues are resolvable assuming I make the right decisions. 

I also am well aware that chronic MJ use plays the biggest part in my mental health conditions, however I had used that to cope with them, up until now when I physically just cannot do that anymore. 

Anyone have anything to say? Not even sure what I’m looking for here, other than someone who has experienced this and understands what I’m going through.

Post 351: Cleanliness is Next to Stresslessness
Content:
It may seem like a no brainer for some and a surprise for others, but **stress** is highly associated with clutter. While living with **depression** can often increase the risk of clutter, studies have shown that the more clutter you are surround in, the more stressful an experience you will have. Living and working in a clean environment is a surefire way to begin eliminating stress from your life. Whether it’s just tidying up more regularly or doing a major overhaul of your clutter, the moral of the story is the same. Less mess equals less **stress**. 

It can be frustrating for many to keep up on household tasks. This is especially true for people who live with others and have varying standards of **cleanliness**. A good way to address this issue is to assign those you live with specific tasks that you can work on so that the **stress** of cleaning up after others is eliminated as well as the messes themselves. 

If you find that you are struggling with people who don’t want to help you keep your environment clean, sometimes the best way to handle it is to take responsibility for yourself and yourself only. Clean your own dishes, do your own laundry, and claim a space for yourself that you can easily maintain without the interference of others. This will help you to wash your hands of a problem that can sometimes seem to have no solution. 

If you find it difficult to keep up on household duties and maintaining a clutter free environment, don’t worry. You’re not alone. You could very easily begin to improve. Take small steps at first in putting a system in place that you can maintain. If things are bad, start one room at a time until completion and have a plan ready to keep it maintained. Set rules for yourself using charts and planners and alarm reminders so you know that on a certain day you will be dusting and doing regular household upkeep.

Once everything is deep cleaned, then maintaining that standard can be as little as ten minutes per day if you break it up into a routine. Then once a month you can begin to do a deep clean so it gets easier and easier to stay on top of the clutter. 

Everything can benefit from having a good system in place. This can be especially true for motivated and busy people. If you are having a hard time juggling your responsibilities and tend to put cleaning at the bottom of the list, you’re not alone. However, it would significantly reduce the **stress** that you are experiencing if you move cleaning up on your list of priorities and develop a regular schedule for your daily routine that includes making sure that the spaces where you spend the most time are as clean as possible!

I’ve never really considered myself a stressed individual but a lot has happened in my life that I kind of swept under the rug and just shrugged about it. Clearly it does get to me because I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder but I can’t seem to recognize it when it occurs. I only know I’m stressed when the panic attacks and anxiety start up and by that point it’s hard to bring down the stress. Has anyone dealt with something similar?

Post 359: All I feel is stress right now
Content:
It died off and now it's come back. I can't feel anything but stress. It's as if it's drowned out everything else and I can't love anything or be happy or even sad. I don't know how to help myself right now. I want to be normal again.

Post 360: Zero Appetite
Content:
Am I the only one who had basically no appetite when I'm stressed? It quite literally makes me sick to eat when I'm stressed or anxious or depressed, or any combination of those.
I figure I need to eat, but I cannot bring myself to eat.
What does everyone else do when this happens? Am I alone in this phenomenon?

Post 361: Mental check in with a stranger. Weird?
Content:
 

Hi This is my very first post on Reddit. I’m 35, transplanted to San Francisco to work in tech two years, and I miss my family very much since they all live really far away from the States.

I know it was my choice, and I should no complain about it.

However, living in a new country, learning a new language, and adapting myself to a new culture have been challenging. I realized my mood has been constantly shifting more often than before. I could be totally okay but irrationally emotional when I experience something that remind me certain past feelings.

I realized I need help. But how?

I am alone here without genuine friends close by. I don’t think talking to my old friends or colleagues could help cus it puts me in a vulnerable position where I’d feel uncomfortable. 

I don’t think I need to seek for a pro therapy yet but I definitely need to feel cared, heard and supported. 

I started to wonder if there’re million of people like me who feel lonely and helpless lightly from time to time. 

Recently, I got connected with a person over the internet. We didn’t know much about each other but we just started this short check-in everyday somehow. I felt there is a hope and need to keep going cus I want to report my daily life briefly to this person. Sometime my day is bad and sometime isn’t. I don’t feel shame if I say I procrastinate today to this person. I actually feel a relief by saying that to a real person even I have no intention to meet with this person in person. 

Am I weird? Would you desire to have this kind of check-in experience with someone that both of you have no clues of who they are?

Post 364: Acknowledge the building stressors in your life. As you age, there will be more and more stress. Learn about this before it's too late...!!
Content:
I am in my early 30's. I just had a birthday of a significant number to me. I had a crisis. I'm still recovering from it. 

Life is getting more and more and more stressful. I've had the same job for 6 years, and it's increasing, too, and my workload is starting to get to me. I've lost the ability to relax so it's hard to distract myself in the evenings. We recently moved into a bigger house with roommates, so there's more responsibility there. 

You might notice that your functioning breaks down. It becomes harder to do things that were once mindless and ordinary. Might even be hard to eat. That's "Burn Out". It's a terrible place to be, and it just gets worse. 

If you have a mental disorder like me, then stress will hit you harder ("I'm working to collect all of them!" is what I joke to my friends in a "maybe-I'm-being-serious" kind of way...).

If you have a mental disorder like me, it'll be hard to regulate stress. Your mind wants to go at its own pace, and there's a pace forced upon you that your mind doesn't like to follow. But in order to survive you must follow it.

You need to find your own pace, and go at that pace as much as freaking possible. 

I've realized, on that birthday mentioned above, that it's damn hard to re-discover your own pace when you've become so used to existing in overwhelming stress.

... we become zombies on auto-pilot to prevent stress from affecting us at every moment. We lose connection with life, existing merely as creatures of survival. This can change, but it is also very hard.

Therapy helps. Medication can help. Routine helps – create whatever patterns you can that re-instill a passion for life. Patterns and routines make you feel in control – you are in control, but control is hard to work up to. I'm working up to it. I feel weak but I'm so damn strong for making it this far, and so are you. 

&#x200B;

So ... don't let stress win. Find your pace. Instill a peace in routine. Slowly work your way up that mountain (like a mountain climber with no gear) and find resting points where you can release your hold and simply rest. Stop and take deep breaths randomly throughout the day. Break the fourth wall and look around you and realize you're in life in that very moment. The destination is not that thing you're doing this evening or this weekend, but that very moment. Whether it's in a line, at work, in traffic, talking to an annoying old acquaintance on the phone, or whatever. That's the moment. Some moments feel better than others, but your mind is capable of making meaningful moments no matter what you're doing. Embrace that truth. Life can be worth it!

Post 365: How to recognize signs of stress in men and tips to manage it
Content:
First understand that stress isn’t always a ‘negative’ thing.

Without experiencing stress, you probably won’t be able to survive. Our ancestors who lived in caves, used stress as a means to alert them of possible danger, like a massive Argentinosaurus huinculensis dinosaur.

Stress is first and foremost a physical response. 

Stress can be summarily divided into two classes:

Eustress: which can be also termed useful or need stress and

Distress: which can also be termed damaging or unhealthy

PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS 

• Feeling of pain around the head, neck, chest, muscles and stomach. 

• Problems with digestion 

• Reproductive problems 

• Changes to the heart and blood pressure. 

• Shortness of breath

•Feeling of fatigue

•Dizziness

•Clenching of jaws and grinding the teeth

•The throat feels dry, tight and when you touch it, it feels like a lump.

•Weight gain.

PHYSCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS

•Depression or general sadness

•Withdrawal and loneliness

•Insomnia

•Increased anxiety and agitation

•Feeing of moodiness, anger and irritations

•Isolation

•Anxiety

•Overeating

•Increased use of alcohol and drugs

•Dissatisfaction

I want to create an app that will help people cope with the stress in their day-to-day lives in realtime, but first I need to collect some data on the matter, so I know which areas to focus on. This survey will only take about 2-3 minutes and all responses are anonymous. Thanks for all your feedback.

Post 367: What should I do about chronic stress
Content:
Hi, I'm 20 years old and kind of accepting that I've got chronic stress issues. I'm not sure how to deal with it exactly, and it's been 3 months. I remember seeing a doctor a while ago and talked about what caused my stress/breakdown last semester and he said it was acute stress. I didn't really know what that meant at the time, but overall I felt like it was an unhelpful experience because all of his advice (exercise, things like that) and wisdom didn't really help me or I knew would not work because I had already tried. I even tried antidepressants because I thought it could have been something I needed, but that did not help. I'd say for the past 2 years of my life I've done a great job at handling acute stress. That was the only type of stress I knew. Chronic stress, however, is something that I don't understand. It's new to me, and requires a greater amount of life changes and mental perspective. It feels inhuman almost to have chronic stress.

It is admittedly frustrating because I feel too young for it; I'm at an age where I should continue to develop myself with my hobbies and stuff. But instead every day is typically a rollercoaster. My ability to concentrate/focus has been incredibly diminished, and I find the idea of getting back in to school stressful. I am an engineering major, but if math stresses me out I'm just not sure if I can keep it in my life. On the flip side, I want to be doing those things because I liked the challenge. The stress is like a token that just keeps flipping and makes things confusing. I doubly worry because I start to think I have mental health issues, and the fact is that stress CAN open up mental health issues. I find that when the stress gets to a breaking point, which has only happened once in my life, I shut down and withdraw and make what changes feel necessary instead of opening up in to some sort of mania or whatever but fuck man how am I supposed to know what to expect if it keeps going. There are things which cause me stress that I don't think are supposed to cause me that much stress, but they simply do because it's chronic I guess. I don't know if I"m supposed to push on and work on my problems in "the storm" or withdraw and bide my time.

I also seem to suffer from anhedonia, an inability to feel pleasure. If I isolate myself from anything stressful (school, work, etc.) it is possible to feel some pleasure, albeit a small amount. I've been trying to tackle the problem by getting back in to the things that used to give me pleasure (weightlifting was a big one) and then taking on the more stressful things (school and work), but the stressful things seem to outdo any pleasure effects. What really kills me is that my sleep suffers; if I could get 8 hours a night, I would be able to push through without worrying, but for the past 3 nights I've gotten probably 5-6 hours of sleep. I haven't even started school yet, and I don't really work THAT much. So now I'm sitting here typing this post and worrying about stress again. I truthfully don't know what to do, or what in particular causes my chronic stress. I want to live life like normally so I can combat depression and things like that, but then the stress keeps me up. I am seeing a counselor, and hopefully a therapist soon, but I am in the early stages of that.

Is this something that can be medicated? Can you "medicate" stress away? Or does it boil down to lifestyle changes? I've done a pretty damn good job of having a healthy lifestyle for the past couple years, which is another frustrating thing. I don't drink, smoke, but admittedly I think about sex too much and I'd say that is my vice at the moment. It was also a source of stress for me that contributed to this chronic stress in some way. That said, I don't pursue sex in an unhealthy way but I might be a little more flirty or resort to jackin it to try and fill some sort of void that I'm missing. I eat pretty healthily, not a fan of soda or junk food, I see food more as calories and less for pleasure. Other than that, I loved weightlifting and for a good while was able to do both cardio and heavy lifting. Now, however, I feel like that contributes to my stress a little bit because I know I don't sleep enough to be able to lift weights and recover without it causing too much stress. I want to bulk up a bit, and get back to more intense/heavier lifting, but I'm not sure if that's even healthy for me in my given state. At the same time, I get stressed out after a week or two if I'm NOT doing that. Lol again with the flipping a token thing.

I don't really like being around my friends or people as much when I'm like this, not because I am in a "bad mood" but because I know I can't simply vibe with them. I'll be too worried about feeling stressed out to actually enjoy it. This is why I think I really like counseling because it's just a place for you to go to talk about your problems with someone.

My only solace has been learning how to play my guitar, but that's not what I intend to do with the rest of my life, and it doesn't always take the stress away. Sometimes I just get tired of playing it.

What are my options? I'm 20 years old, live at home with my dad, so I don't have much responsibility thankfully. I've done quite a bit with my life that I'm happy about, so I feel like I was doing what I wanted, so it's tough thinking about how to change. All the things I've been doing have helped me grow as a person and alleviate that sort of depression you get when you're just not doing anything with yourself. But again now when I start doing those things I experience a lot of stress and have to come to a stop, thus depression can come back... I kind of yearn for when things didn't feel this stressful; the first two years of college feel like they could have been ages ago, and man I thought THAT was a challenge because during that time I was just finding myself. Looking back on it though it was just easy to live in the present and deal with stress as it came, not battling it every waking hour. I understand things about mindfulness, meditation, making the right choices, etc., but man that doesn't explain why I can't get enough sleep.

So, it's all there in the title and i don't know what more to say. I guess i will be updating this post on what i do and what helps.

So i will be writing down all of my activities and hobbies ect, and find out witch ones i can quit \(i will be posting the thing with all my activities here eventually\).

EDIT:Oh btw, just to give an example, i am using Todoist to track my tasks. I have 53 tasks for today since i always need to postpone.

Post 370: Right now in my life I am so frustrated
Content:
Right now in my life I am so frustrated with everything around me that it has left me tired. Everyday I search for a moment of happiness to feel good about myself, but there is nothing that makes me feel good. I keep myself busy in my studies(started my masters this August) to take my mind off negative things. but everything around me hits my mind so badly that i cannot control the impact of anything. I no more have control on anything that happens to me, everything just happens and I just respond as I am supposed to. People around me are always demanding, they want something from me every now and then, and its not friendship that they want but just some favors I know they will never return. And right now I don't even have any friends to talk to, to deal with everything with me or even to keep me sane. Everyday has become exhausting and I just feel like to leave everything, do nothing, no studies, no job , no people, leave everything and live somewhere in peace. But I know I cannot just cut off from everything, I have to have masters degree, get a job., but this journey is so stressful, I wish I could have someone just to listen what I have to say about everything going on with me. and I wish I could just get a moment to breathe.

Post 371: I feel like I'm watching my life crash and I can't stop it
Content:
This all started in October. I lost my mom on the 11th, that alone is still hard to deal with. She was my rock, my person to run to when I was stressed or couldn't figure how to handle certain things as a parent or as an adult. There were understandably missed days of work, which caused lost wages. Only two days were covered for me and my husband was out of vacation days, none were covered for him. This caused us to fall back on a few bills. We live on a tight budget as it is, there was no insurance for mom, so no way to financially put back our wages. It started a slow spiral littered with late fees. And then came early December where we had a choice of keeping our place to live or keeping our car, we lost our car. Luckily my dad was able to step in and was helping us get to and from work until we could get a car. But three days ago they put his dad on the morphine drip. He is watching his dad die in the same slow manner he watched my mom. The hospice nurses (oddly the same ones who saw my mom out) have turned his oxygen up to 5 and understandably my dad doesn't want to leave his side. So here we are I'm about to call my job for the second day and beg for a ride or not to get fired. My husbands parents are sort of helping him but still leaving it up in the air everyday before he is supposed to be at work. but I work the overnight. No one is willing to help me get there and home. We have called taxi services around us. It would cost over 100 for him to get to work and back and close to 50 for me. This is crazy and I'm so nervous. Everything at once, I'm worried about losing my job then losing the roof we fought so hard to keep over our kids head, we gave up our car to keep. No matter how hard we work no matter that both of us have rarely missed days and worked for the same companies for years, both very good workers but one horrible moment in my life has us standing on the edge of losing everything. We make too much to ask the state for help but not enough to miss a few days to grieve the loss of the best person in our family without ruining our lives. I'm just on the edge and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do anymore and the one person who would know, who could help isn't around to help us. Thanks for listening well reading I guess.

Post 372: How To Manage The Voice Between Your Ears – Less Stress, Less Anxiety, More Focus, More Happiness
Content:
We all have this voice between the ears that either helps us progress or regress. It’s talking to you all day long, from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep. The conversation is nonstop. When you are unaware of this, it will yank you around causing you to spiral out of control. It tells you to eat that cookie. It tells you to get fired up and angry. It tells you to react, react, and react some more. It’s what makes you check your email 53 times a day. It’s what allows you to lose your temper when it might be unwise.

Most of us are never really fully present in what’s going on right now. We subconsciously believe that the next moment must be more important than this one. ‘I’ll be happier when I get a new job. I’ll be happier when I get married. Never mind, I’ll be happier when I have a kid. Well that’s not working, maybe I’ll be happier if I buy a cabin in the mountains. Nope, that’s not working either. Well, it’s definitely the shore house I always dreamed of having. Nope, that’s not it either. Maybe it’s grandkids.’ Before you know it, you have missed your whole life because you couldn’t tolerate the now.

“Your inner narrator, the voice that chases you out of bed in the morning and yammers at you all day long. It has you constantly comparing yourself to other people, engaging in ruthless self-criticism, and casting forward into the future or ruminating about the past, to the detriment of whatever is happening right now.” — Eckhart Tolle

So what do you do? How can you manage the circus inside your head? 

I can’t tell you the definite answer to that question. What I can tell you is that the stories your inner narrator is telling you has no relationship to reality. Of course, there are times where it has great ideas. But you have to have awareness to be able to step out of that traffic to see if it’s a good idea or a terrible one. This awareness is often referred to as mindfulness. It is an innate part of our human capacity. You just need to step out of the noise for just a little bit.

We evolved from threat detection. Constantly being on guard. So when our body thinks we are in danger, it shuts down.

The first step is to understand that we have the ability to hack our minds and get out of this rut.
The next step is to  view mental exercise the same way we view physical exercise.
Every time you get lost in thought and you notice that it’s happening, that’s a rep for your brain.

Meditation Explained For The Skeptical, Practical Person

You may believe that meditation is ‘woo-woo’ stuff and that it’s not for you. That’s okay. There is plenty of research being uncovered by neuroscientists that are showing you how meditation is literally changing the brain. But if you’re skeptical, let me tell you what it is and how you can take a practical approach to trying this out.

Meditation is about learning to RESPOND not REACT.

It’s about feeling your breath coming in. Feeling it coming out. Your breath is the one thing that remains constant 24/7. It’s easy to set your attention on this. Every time you get distracted you just start over. And over. And over again.

I tried to do it for a very long time and had a full-on collision with the voices in my head. It’s easy to dismiss it as something that’s not for you. ‘I just can’t sit still and not think for that long.’ Does that sound familiar?

The other side of the coin is that if you can’t sit still and remove yourself from the noise for just 5 minutes out of the 1,440 minutes in the day…it’s  probably a good idea to address this.

The Secret To Meditation

Here’s the secret. You can’t win at meditation. It’s not a competitive sport. You’re winning as soon as you realize that the clown in your head is just a clown. That’s all it is. We’re telling ourselves a bunch of stories all day long. It’s not a reality until you make it reality.

The first 7-10 days will be absolutely terrible. You’re thinking is it lunch? Do I need a haircut? Is my boss going to ask me to stay late today? Do we have groceries? That’s absolutely normal. After 10 days (more or less), you’ll start to be somewhat conscious of your breathing. Not only during the time you set aside to do so, but when you’re going about your day to day activities. That is the ultimate goal, right? 10 days might be a stretch, it takes some people weeks, months, or even years. The point is that you show up every single day and spend .004% of your day practicing. Don’t put expectations on yourself that are unattainable. It’s all about progressing a little bit at a time.

I’m not saying that you’re never going to get angry or sad again. That’s not the point. Those are necessary emotions to experience from time to time. But you will be 10x better at managing these emotions when they arise and simply moving on.

Easiest way to get started?

Use an app. It’s really not complicated, we make it complicated. It’s just about breathing in and breathing out. The app is just a cool way to stay accountable. I love using one in particular called Headspace. You can see how much total time you’ve spent meditating. You can also see how many days in a row you’ve been practicing. It is a form of guided meditation, which is a nice touch. So when you get lost in thought, every once in a while you have a gentle reminder to focus back on the breath.

I’ve also just set a timer and played around with different breathing methods. That works really well too. Here is one of my favorites called the ‘Wim Hof Method’:

Take 30 deep breaths. In through your nose. Out through your mouth.
Don’t overthink it, just breathe.
On your 31st breath, as you breathe out fully getting rid of all the stale air, hold your breath. Do not let any air come in. Hold it.
The gasp-reflex will happen automatically and you will inhale one of the most fulfilling breaths ever.
Hold it for 15 seconds.
Exhale.
Take a few normal breaths.
That is one cycle. Should take you less than 5 minutes.

The Reward?

Your senses are incredibly sharp. You can hear the birds singing in the trees. Your food tastes amazing. You’re not obsessing about things. You’re just enjoying being right there with everything that’s happening right now.

   I wish I could change things and make things better not so much for myself because I dont really deserve good things, but really for my wife. 
My wife is the only thing that keeps me going and even then I dont deserve her. Ive been a terrible husband to her. I had an affair with a coworker at my last job just six months into our marriage. It took me so long to get her to even speak to me again and talk about what happend and if there was ever a chance on us trying again. 

 I dont know why but she gave me a chance and Ive busted my ass to fix my marriage and we just celebrated our 4th year together this past july. We barely survive paycheck to paycheck and ive never been able to give her a honeymoon or anything she really deserves but she says that doesnt matter and she loves me. I wish I could give her at least a vacation at least so she can get out of town and relax a bit.

She works so hard and deserves so much more than what I can give her and it kills me. We have to live in a shitty house with no heat thats falling apart, no car because ours is dead and there's no fixing it so she has to get bitched at everyday so she can borrow her mothers car so she can go to work. I dont know what to do and god....im sorry I know I sound like a whiny fuck but I dont know what else to do.

Post 377: Any tips on controlling stress?
Content:
So, I'd say I have a problem with stress, especially with controlling it. I think it might be starting to affect my health, so I want to do something about it. I always get stressed, even for the smallest things. I'd say I have some sort of Social anxiety, but not really. I am most definitely an extrovert and I mostly don't have a problem speaking to people. But sometimes it's so nerve-racking. Also, public speaking is my worst nightmare. I know, almost nobody likes it, but I feel like I'm near death before public speaking. I hate presentations or saying anything in class. It's most likely something to do with my self-confidence. I also have a fear of being judged and failing, which plays a massive part in the stress. I don't think this is bad enough to go to a therapist, I mean I could, but honestly, I'm scared and would most definitely be stressed to go there lol. I always try to tell myself ''What's the worst that could happen?'' or ''Who cares what they think'' but it just doesn't help, like at all. I think it wouldn't be so bad if I knew how to control my stress. Any help is appreciated!

Like I should be doing something more productive with my time. There's just this lingering feeling whenever I'm out with friends or at a show that I shouldn't be there. 

I have a moderate amount of free time between the 3 gigs I work serving/bartending. But any free time I have is used to cook myself food, play games with my guy or watch TV.  But somehow I can't fully engage with what I'm doing without thinking what ELSE I should be doing.

Post 379: I have been going through a whole lotta stress and it's showing
Content:
I'm a (25F) uni student studying pub policy. For the past few months, I have been so stressed to the point of it showing. I'm hopeful that things will change because I'm working on it one at a time. I'm mostly stressed based on financing uni, my GPA (which is no longer at the distinction level), and the health of my stepmom. 

I've been grinding my teeth a whole lot (never experienced this so the headache is severe), according to my doctor I've lost 15 pounds, work has been stressful, my health seems to be deteriorating, I've had an abnormal appetite for the past 5 months, hardly getting much sleep, went through a devastating break up with my abusive ex-fiance and I'm still trying to cope from that. Honestly trying to be more merciful with myself but goddamit, this shit is exhausting. As of late, I've been considering suicide but I keep telling myself that I'd be selfish to do so because I have my mom and sister to look out for. I even resigned because added to the already present craziness and lack of accountability at work from coworkers, I don't think I'm fit to continue working (if I continue, I personally don't think I'd be productive). I have other projects I'm working on for work but I'll complete them from home. I'm literally tired and because I don't vent to anyone, people seem to think I'm forever okay and I'm unbothered, I hate that. Honestly, I'm just venting because I needed to get some out of my head.

Post 380: Sudden feeling like someone is yelling at me
Content:
Hi everyone, I’ve had this since I was very young and I don’t know what it is. I’ll just be causally laying or sitting when all of a sudden in my head it will be a feeling like someone is yelling at me. Like I will be in complete silence but feel the yelling, even in silence the feeing is there of someone causing me urgency and stress. I don’t know what it is but I’ve also had dreams that cause the same urgency and sometimes even despair. It freaks me out and I don’t even know how to talk about or explain it if I were to go get medical attention. 

If anyone has experienced something similar can you give me some insight on what it could be and how I can lessen its effects?

Post 381: Is it common to experience extreme tiredness after a very stressful period is over in your life?
Content:
I have been searching for a job for months and been extremely hypervigilant. Now I got a job and I feel very relieved but notice I am extremely tired. 

Is my body simply catching up with some missed sleep?

Post 382: Feeling brain dead after stress…
Content:
I recently went through a few weeks of intense stress, anxiety and depression. A lot of bad things happened all at once and that was the most horrible I’ve felt… I think in my entire life 

Thankfully, I’m on the other side now and starting to feel better. But I literally feel brain dead. 

I’m so tired even though I’ve been sleeping decently. I just feel empty in my brain.

Anyone else experience this? Any ways to feel better?

Post 383: Moving is stressing me out
Content:
Moving is seriously stressing me out. I keep having breakdowns while packing and sometimes I feel totally unable to get anything done. It all just feels so overwhelming.

I'm moving out of the place I've been living at alone for 2 years and I'm moving in with my boyfriend. I love him but the relationship is still so new and I've never lived with a partner before. This is mostly happening because I can't afford my apartment anymore after getting into serious credit card debt and that makes it all feel so much worse. It feels like I failed myself and messed up my life.

He is so kind but I'm also getting a storage unit because I have so much stuff I want to keep and while he is making room for some of it his apartment is smaller than mine and my place is full of stuff. It just really hurts me that I have to pack up the life that I've spent time and effort building for myself and shove it all into a storage unit. 

My boyfriend and I are really optimistic and I do look forward to a future with him but letting go is really hard and this whole thing is just really been a struggle for me. It's been such a rough year and I'm just trying to hold on.

Post 384: Stress Busting Activities to Reduce Tension Without Medication
Content:
Stress is an inevitable part of our lives, and in today's fast-paced world, it's more prevalent than ever. The demands of work, family, and daily responsibilities can pile up, leading to chronic tension and anxiety. While medication may be a solution for some, there are numerous stress-busting activities that can help reduce tension naturally and effectively. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore a range of techniques and practices that can empower you to manage stress, boost your overall well-being, and regain control of your life.  
  
**1. Mindful Meditation: A Journey Inward**  
  
Meditation has been practiced for centuries as a powerful tool for stress reduction. By taking a few moments each day to sit in a quiet space, focus on your breath, and clear your mind, you can experience a profound sense of calm. Mindful meditation not only helps reduce immediate stress but can also enhance your emotional resilience over time.  
  
**2. Yoga: The Union of Body and Mind**  
  
Yoga is more than just a physical practice; it's a holistic approach to reducing stress and promoting well-being. Through a series of postures, breathing exercises, and meditation, yoga can help you release physical and emotional tension. It improves flexibility, strength, and mental clarity, fostering an overall sense of balance.  
  
**3. Exercise: The Natural Stress Reliever**  
  
Physical activity is a natural stress reliever. When you engage in regular exercise, your body releases endorphins, often referred to as "feel-good" hormones. These endorphins can elevate your mood and reduce stress levels. Whether it's a brisk walk, a challenging workout, or a relaxing swim, find an exercise routine that suits your preferences and schedule.  
  
**4. Art Therapy: Creativity as a Stress Outlet**  
  
Creating art, be it through drawing, painting, or crafting, can be a therapeutic outlet for stress. Engaging in creative activities allows you to express your emotions, thoughts, and feelings in a non-verbal way. Art therapy can help you gain insight into your stressors and find inner peace through creativity.  
  
**5. Nature Walks: Reconnect with the Outdoors**  
  
Spending time in nature is a simple yet highly effective way to reduce stress. The natural world has a calming effect on our minds and bodies. Take a leisurely stroll through a park, forest, or along the beach. The beauty of nature and the tranquility it provides can be a powerful stress antidote.  
  
**6. Deep Breathing: Instant Stress Relief**  
  
Deep breathing exercises are a quick and accessible stress-reduction technique. When stress hits, pause for a moment, close your eyes, and take slow, deep breaths. Deep breathing oxygenates your body and triggers a relaxation response, helping to soothe your nerves.  
  
**7. Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Unwind Your Tension**  
  
Progressive muscle relaxation is a systematic technique that involves tensing and then releasing different muscle groups in your body. It helps you become more aware of physical tension and can lead to profound relaxation. Practice this technique regularly to unwind your stress-induced muscle tightness.  
  
**8. Aromatherapy: Scented Serenity**  
  
Aromatherapy harnesses the power of essential oils to calm your mind and reduce stress. Scents like lavender, chamomile, and eucalyptus are known for their relaxing properties. Use essential oils in a diffuser, add a few drops to a warm bath, or apply them topically for a fragrant stress-relief experience.  
  
**9. Journaling: Self-Reflection for Stress Management**  
  
Keeping a journal is a powerful way to reflect on your thoughts and emotions. Writing down your worries, fears, and stresses can help you gain clarity and perspective. It's a form of self-therapy that allows you to process your feelings and find solutions to your stressors.  
  
**10. Social Connection: The Power of Relationships**  
  
Human connections are essential for reducing stress. Spending time with loved ones, sharing your concerns, and receiving emotional support can alleviate tension. Don't hesitate to lean on your friends and family when stress becomes overwhelming.  
  
**In conclusion,** stress is a part of life, but it doesn't have to control your well-being. By incorporating these stress-busting activities into your daily routine, you can reduce tension naturally, improve your overall quality of life, and regain control of your emotional and physical health. Remember, the key to effective stress management is consistency. Experiment with these techniques, find what works best for you, and make them a part of your daily life. Embrace the power of these natural stress-busting activities and take the first step towards a more balanced, relaxed, and fulfilling life.

Post 385: Stress taking over life
Content:
Everyday I'm learning something about stress that i didn't think was possible. 

From the last one year, the kind of hairfall I'm witnessing is unexplainable. I've had headaches in the past, but nothing like the one's I'm having. It gets completely dark, and the way it pounds, I feel like physically hurting it will be better because atleast that will stop. I already had stomach issue but now I have GERD. And lately I've been having eye spasm (it's been twitching crazy). I've read everywhere that it goes away in sometime and that caffeine or lack of sleep is the reason, but I've been sleeping okay, and don't drink coffee at all. 

I've seen multiple doctors but all of them just say it's because of stress and that i should work on that. But I don't know how to control it? Like, I thought everyone lives with that level of stress. I think I can't breath well these days, and little little things send me off. As in, I can literally feel my whole body getting hotter. 

I don't enjoy this kind of living and kind of envy when I see people who are able to laugh off things and move on. Any sort of tangible tips or workable advice would be great, from someone who's gone through something similar.

Post 388: Heart palpitations..
Content:
How do I accept that my heart palpitations are just a part of my anxiety? I spiral into a panic attack every single time I feel one😭 They are SO beyond scary & each time I get one I feel this impending doom feeling & tell myself that this is it - it’s my time😞 It’s horrendous, how do I accept it’s just anxiety/panic induced & not a health concern? I’ve had all the tests necessary, all results are fine of course. I just have a bit of sinus tachycardia (fast heart rate) on & off due to my anxiety/stress. Does anyone else suffer with this? How do you all deal with it? What are your coping mechanisms?!

Post 389: Chronic stress(please help)

Can anybody help me find way to deal with stress?? Ive had severe stress as long as i can remember (im 21 now) 

In 2018 i was throwing up much from it i dropped 10kg and im so underweight but cant put it back on from stress the doctors  genuinely thought i might of had cancer. 

My chest is tight all the time my jaw just from clenching and grinding even in my sleep, i developed trachyardia where my heart can sporatically go up to 150+bpm  

i try take deep breaths when i can but i breathe so shallow 99% of the time its a new nornal. 

I feel so nauseas or throw uo everytime i eat and now even when i drink water i cant afford to drop anymore weight. My body hurts all the time i have headaches, chronic UTI's from stress i physically cannot deal anymore. Ive tried esting healthy, exercising, picking up a new hobby, ive been on anti depressants, i was on an anti-psychotic but had to stop due to clash in work and feeling too drowsy after taking it. Any alternatives that you can recommend that arent just more meditation or deep bresthing? (Tried that too)

Post 390: Can stress cause memory loss?
Content:

My husband is 35 male, fit and healthy. Never had any previous medical issues and isn’t on any drugs and a non smoker. 

He works as a PE teacher and I would say had been pretty stressed out over the past month or so. He has had a few head knocks over the years as a child and two concussions from playing rugby for pretty much his whole life. 

Over the past couple of weeks he has started to forget things and he is really worried about it. He couldn’t remember the name of our sons old school (I would say a tricky thing to remember at times) but the worst one was he couldn’t remember the road near our house for about an hour the other day. It’s really really worrying him and we have made a doctors appointment but not for another 2 weeks! 

Can stress cause memory problems like this or should we start planning for a more serious diagnosis?

Post 393: I feel like I'm becoming too sensitive.. or that I'm offended by everything.
Content:
Wasnt surrounded by very nice people nice places or nice things. For the most part growing up I feel like I had some pretty thick skin... then as time went by and life took its toll on me, the stress anxiety and depression happened to wear me down. 

I don't feel like I have a hard shell like I used to. Almost everything people tell me I feel like rubs off the wrong way; whether they mean it or not. I can take a joke but when it comes to general comments or statements I possibly overthink and get upset over it. At the time I wanna give a smart remark but hold myself back often.. Can there be an underlying issue? Possibly the result of trauma

I'm personally taking a week off of everything to reset.

Post 396: Getting stressed over emails and minor mistakes
Content:
Hi all. 

I’ve just started my first job out of uni in a very high stress field with strict timelines (m&a). I’ve noticed that when I send out emails, I overthink and stress over every little bit (aka am I spelling names correctly, does it make sense) to the point I’m wasting time. When I do send out ‘wrong’ emails (aka it double sent or some wires were crossed) I freak out and get way too much adrenaline - I feel like I’ll puke and I get very warm. I know I won’t lose my job over this but I can’t help but overthink. It’s literally to the point that I’m wondering whether this is the right field for me even though I really do like my job. Are there some techniques I can undertake to manage this? Or will it just take time?

Post 397: How to stop getting angry and cope healthily?
Content:
I’ve been putting it to the side thinking it’s not that serious and that i’ll be fine eventually. 

Well, for the past couple days everything is making me extremely angry and I never cry but I keep crying when I get too angry and then I feel sad. I haven’t dealt with sad feelings like this since I was a teenager. I know it’s stress causing it. I constantly feel a lump in my throat. It’s so scary because I thought I knew how to regulate my feelings. I mean at least I did for years.  

I want to just run away and hide alone and never see anyone again because i’m so frustrated. I need some tips on how to healthily deal with this before it’s too late. Thanks in advance :)

Side note: I never take it out on anyone or anything like that. I’m scared I will snap someday and do that. That’s how my dad acts and I hate people who are like that and I really don’t want to be one of them.

Post 398: Anyone figured out stress yet?
Content:
I'm a mid 30's man with a somewhat stressful job and feels like I can't keep stress under control. I have high BP and just the smallest thing sends me into a spiral. I try everything, meditation, exercise (have lost 50 pounds so far), yoga, eating healthy. I go to the doctor and I get that sense of "impending doom" and my BP goes through the roof. I feel 100% fine in the moment, I am chill and relaxed as a cucumber, but I Think subconsciously my body is freaking out? I assume this is stress. I know white coat syndrome is real, but when I go in the dr's office it happens without fail. and of course my BP reading is high. I just wish I could control my mind LOL. My dr. did tests to see if my cortisol levels are off, and they are perfect. Bloodwork is perfect.They did MRI's of my heart, probably a half dozen other tests to check if my heart is okay, and it is. Which tells me this is likely stress related BP. I am doing so well health wise, and with the weight loss I thought I'd see more progress in stress relief, but it is still happening and my BP still spikes due to stress. It's like my body is triggered ridiculously by it, and I wish there was a magic button to fix it. Is there anything you all do that maybe I could try that I am not trying? I have googled my a$$ off trying to find the solutions, but I feel they just say to "manage stress" and it's not that easy for some of us. I go for 1-2 walks a day, I exercise, I eat healthy and try to avoid inflammatory foods. I have been sleeping well, at least my fitness tracker says so. I do not know what else I could possibly do but I am hoping I can find that thing that works for me. Thank you all.

Post 399: Recently I’ve been incredibly critical about getting school work done way ahead of time, but now it’s just getting ridiculous
Content:
(Canadian college student btw) I used to be the complete opposite. I would do assignments a couple days before it was due and have zero stress

However recently I’m getting assignments done WEEKS ahead of time, which I’m proud of tbh. I’m taking my education more seriously, and It’s like a need to get it done with better quality, thus making more time for myself and picking up extra shifts at my retail job. 

…but now it’s just getting ridiculous. We’re not even in week 3 and I’m stressing about getting an assignment done on time for week 6. I literally cannot fall asleep some nights because I’m thinking too much about it. 

How tf do I deal with this? How do I convince myself that it’ll get done, and it doesn’t have to be done right in this moment?

Post 400: Help me please. Insomnia from 1 year. It feels like dying everyday
Content:
Hello everybody. I am facing insomnia from the past one year. I got covid one year before. I was in hospital and at that time every few hours somebody is dying in front of me. I got so scared and anxiety hit me so hard that my mouth remains dry, my hands were shaking, my heartbeat doubles. I feels like i am going to die and this thought didn't let me sleep for 20 days straight in a row. Covid gone but now i got insomnia. I went to bed but didn't get even a single minute of sleep. I got so frustrated, the days was like hell, it was like somebody just take my soul out of body, i don't want to live anymore. Tried melatonin, Vitamin B6 Tablet, Got sunlight daily, nothing works. Then I consult to a doctor. She prescribed me to take clonazepam .25mg for 4 weeks and along to take mirtazapine 7.5mg. Then as per doctors suggestion i stopped taking clonazepam after 4 weeks and continued to take mirtazapine 7.5 mg. It was good for 8 months. I started exercise 30mins daily. Walk for 5 km daily. Now Few days before my body again started to facing insomnia( there is no stress, the insomnia comes automatically). In 10 days duration my sleep got reduced to 1 hour per day and now after 10 days i got no sleep not even a single minute. I don't know what happens to my body, i talked to my close persons tell about my problem but nobody understands me. Should i give a try to homeopathy medicine? I am sharing this to everybody on reddit, so that if anybody has any solution please guide me.

Post 401: Feel like I’m losing control of my brain
Content:
A lot has happened to me and I feel like I’m going actually crazy.
It all started in late 2019 and 2020
I started dealing w panic attacks for the first time which severely mentally fucked me up. 
Was having attacks everyday for months on end. And this is around the time I started drinking heavily. It was the only thing helping me. 
Then I started to develop vertigo, just randomly it would feel like I’m falling or the ground was swaying back and forth and it still happens to this day randomly 
Cut to me a little later in life I managed to cut the stress back a lot and I was happy but then we’ll ofc it came back. 
Recently the alcohol caught up to me and my system and I drank so much developed gastritis and I’m going thru that rn. Stomach pain sucks so much luckily it isn’t to bad but unlocked my health phobia my brain is constantly hurting, my brain feels like it’s on the verge of just going crazy, feels like I can’t control my thoughts, my heart skips beats. 
The way I figured I was truly stressed was my teeth never noticed it before but I clench my teeth pretty much the whole day causing my head to start hurting it’s all too much and now it’s ruining my sleep I truly hate this I truly do. I miss being young w no worries. 
I just am so done so so done

Post 402: How do I not stress about something MAJOR?
Content:
I’m always stressed about little things or things not under my control etc etc. but this time it’s about something actually life-changing and what I do or say could absolutely change the outcome entirely. This is very important and very serious and the tiniest error in my part could severely cost me. How am I not supposed to stress about it? I’m thinking about it all the time even when I try my best not to by going out, watching something, playing a game, or even trying to nap (I have dreams about it). It’s gotten to the point where it’s affecting my overall health. I feel fatigued, depressed, and anxious… much, much more than usual. This also isn’t something that’s gonna be quick and short, it’s something that will be ongoing for years… it technically has already been going on for years but now it’s about to get so much more serious. Anyway, what am I supposed to do?

Post 403: I’ve only just realised how badly stressed I am but I don’t know what to do, no one will take me seriously
Content:
I, 20F, have a few things that just seem off to me. I have a job that I hate, it’s my first job, it’s a 9-5 in a high pace high stress environment and when I make a mistake it has an effect - and of course I do make mistakes. My coworker also treats me like a personal assistant and delegates all of her last minute jobs to do immediately without thanks which is so stressful as I can never complete a project on time because of it. Enough backstory though this isn’t a life advice sub I just need to rant about the things I think are caused by stress?

I’ve always looked young for my age, I take good care of my skin using retinol and SPF 50 every day yet my skin is ageing (I turned 20 a month ago so this is weird). I look heavier than I am, I get a lot of exercise (10K steps minimum daily plus cardio focussed gym 2-5 times a week depending how tired i am) and do not over eat, if anything (tw) I probably under eat by a long way because I lose my appetite and forget to eat. It’s just bizarre to me and it’s not that I want to be thinner but I know that with my lifestyle I ought to be a lot thinner than I am so I’ve no clue what the reasoning for that is. My psoriasis is getting worse. It used to be a small patch on my leg but now I’ve got it on my lips, cheeks, back and it’s spreading down my arm. I was researching self soothing and I do that obsessively, I bite my lips to oblivion and crack my knuckles to the point where they hurt. I am ALWAYS tired even if I get 14 hours of sleep, luckily my insomnia has gone away for the time being but that used to be really bad too. I also get migraines the second I begin to relax. If it’s not pretty obvious ill just throw in that I have been diagnosed with anxiety. My doctor doesn’t want to help and there’s no free therapy in my area as there’s massive wait lists for everything. So I’m on here hoping to find someone who might relate. Can this all be due to stress? Do you have any advice? My job contract ends soon and I’m not renewing it don’t worry but I know any entry level job will be just as intense so how can I manage it and minimise these symptoms? My family doesn’t seem to care and just say it’s life but I’m going to spiral if I can’t control it.

Post 404: Tips on dealing with stress headaches?
Content:
Hi! I’m someone who normally never gets headaches, but I think I might be dealing with stress headaches. I’ve been going through a lot of change that is creating a lot of stress in my life and difficulty sleeping (even with melatonin/gummies that supposed to help me sleep). I’ve been having headaches for the last couple days and had one all day today since I woke up. What are some ways to deal with stress headaches?

Post 405: I live at my parents house, I don't have to pay bills, I don't have a job, I don't study, BUT I still feel stressed out and exhausted. Even without a job and responsibilities, I still have so many things that I have to do, or worry about. Why is life so stressful? What can I do about it?
Content:
I have to work on my health. I have to make doctor appointments. I have to go to therapists. I have to maintain my friendships. I have to figure out which religion I'm going to follow (I believe in God but was grown up atheist, so religion is what I'm figuring out currently). I have to deal with friends that got mad at me, or are about to leave me. I have to deal with my mental issues. I have to fix my laptop and my phone. I have to figure out what career I wanna do in my life. I have to enjoy free time. And alot more things that I didnt think of right now.

I \*have to\* to so many things, that it drains all my energy and motivation. If I had a job, or was still studying, it would have been MUCH worse for me. Its the reason why I was forced to quit studying earlier this year.

I worry about so many things, and I have so many things on my to-do list, it is simply more than I can handle. This feels like a 168 hours per week job that never ends.

And yes, I do take free time to relax. I play videogames, I go outside for walks, and ofcourse I sleep. HOWEVER, I always feel guilty when forcing myself to have free time. "I have so many things on my to-do list which is growing bigger every day, I should be working hard to prevent my to-do list from getting bigger right now, but I'm wasting my time on entertainment right now". With this feeling in the back of my mind, I cannot really enjoy free time that I take (which feels like cheating, its like borrowing money because youre in big debt, but here I'm borrowing free time from the future because I'm in big debt) I cannot relax. No matter what I do. Whetner I'm working on my "have to's" or trying to relax with free time, I always feel like there is so much that I still have to do, and my motivation is completely 0.

My life has too many "have to" activities, which I cannot all do at the same time, but I always feel guilty about not working as hard as I could. On the other side, I completely have no motivation to work on anything.

My to-do list grows bigger every day, and it's making me insane.

Post 406: Sick all the time?
Content:
Hi all,

I'm always super stressed because of my job and the option of quitting or even taking a vacation just isn't possible right now. The problem is I'm literally always sick- before my previous manager left the stress was high and I was getting a cold or flu around once a month, but now it's almost every week or two that I gotta call of work for being sick. I just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this and if you have any tips that could help! 

Thanks!!

Post 407: catching up after depressive episode
Content:
tw: suicide, depression, mental illness 

in february, i fell into a really bad depressive episode. it felt like there wasn’t any point in doing anything so i just gave up doing any work. like, i stopped putting effort into anything and any minor inconvenience triggered a suicide attempt. i never took an official break so i am still enrolled and i just kept getting extensions. the university has been supportive and they are willing to give me as much time as i need as i communicated with them how bad it got. 
now i am getting better, i have been attempt free for the past few weeks and i have been improving my negative coping mechanisms. but now i have to catch up with everything i have neglected over the past few months. the thing is, my mood is still crap. i have zero energy to do anything but i have started to care about things again which makes it even more difficult than the past because i can’t just say well i’ll be dead so it won’t matter. 
i don’t know an efficient way of catching up that won’t burn me out so i can stop being so stressed over catching up all the time despite my mood. i’m just so tired and it just feels like i still want things to stop but this time it’s because i care too much.

Hello. I'm only 20 and have been experiencing chronic stress after some health issues which has in turn made it even worse. I can't take my blood pressure without stressing out which gives very high readings like 170/104 and in some cases even higher. I don't know how to address this because I'm too young for this honesty.

Post 410: How do I not be stressed about little things?

I find myself having a panic attack about such little things. My heart starts pounding my head starts to hurt about things I shouldn’t work about. I was just having a panic attack about whether I had a rehearsal tomorrow or not. How do I not do this?

Post 411: Am I stressed?
Content:
I experience a lot of physical symptoms that can all be caused by stress. I have tried to minimize all other causes and stress seems to be the common one. These include; IBS, exzema, loss of period (6 months now), neck and shoulder pain,  now my jaw hurts all the time (like I'm clenching at night).  I can't find other reasons for these symptoms. I have had blood tests done, I try to "relax", exercise once in a while. I eat mostly healthy foods and got rid of big trigger foods. Got a nightguard.  I even just started talking to a therapist. 

The reason I'm confused is because I have had really tough and unbearable moments of stress in my life - but not recently. In fact I'd say I'm the most comfortable and happy that I've been in a very very long time. Whats been stressing me out the most is all of these symptoms and trying to figure out what's wrong with me. When I was ACTUALLY going through stressful times,  I barely felt any physical side effects.  Or maybe I just didn't notice them.  But I'm doing so much better now in my life and I get really frustrated and quite frankly pissed off that my body is causing me more anxiety and stress than anything else in my life is. 

Doctors can't find what's wrong with me,  and they all say stress can be the most obvious reason.  But what do they want me to do,  yoga all day? I have also tried weed but I only get sleepy and I have a lot of work to get done (I enjoy my work). My husband is a great wall to lean on and always helps me feel like there is no problem we can't fix.  So why am I always feeling so uptight and worried? I feel like everything is going so well and one day it will all implode. 

If it IS stress.  How do you release tension when you don't know where it's coming from?

Post 412: Not feeling stressed when I should be.
Content:
I feel like I have ascended or something. Like I'm so stressed that I don't feel it anymore. I feel totally calm and relaxed which is freaking me out because I *should* be feeling stressed. I have no right to relax when I know I have a lot of stressful stuff coming up. Like I almost feel guilty about not feeling stressed, which, yes, I realise is fucked up. 

Anyone else experience this?

Post 413: The Work Abuse and Trauma.
Content:
I can't wait to get to know who I am again. I have lost myself in the extreme stress I have endured for so long. When I look in the mirror, I don't even know my face anymore. I used to just paint my face as best as I could every day to cover up the sadness and exhaustion I felt, while worrying about the war and chaos I was about to walk into each day. That is, if I didn't ovesleep from exhaustion. Then I would hastily put on some clothes I could find laying around, and drive to that dungeon of a job. 

I would spend every ounce of enegy at this job. I used to wake up at the last minute for work. My heart would be pounding. I would sleep 3-4 hours a night, the more short staffed we became... Hungover every day because I drank to cope with the inhumane amount of stress, red eyes, legs feeling like jello, my left leg went numb, I would violently shake and sob while feeling so weak from barely eating... I just had to survive another day there. Just one more day, I would tell myself. Just one more day, one more day, one more day. I knew how much my friends would suffer if I wasn't there for even just one day, I tried to put in my two weeks in with the owner... I was so sure in my mind that I was done because of how much I was physically and mentally suffering. We were alone in his office for over an hour.. I told him I was suicidal, beyond anxious, physically ill from the stress that is put on me... And he covered it up with praise and compliments to me. Asked me to give him just ONE more chance. The new girl would be the savior of the day (even though everyone quits almost immediately after starting.) They are immediately overworked from the moment they start. If they don't quit immediately, then it's after a month. If it's not after a month, it's because they feel so stuck there and manipulated that they can't ever leave because they see no other option for themselves, and because they see other people suffering so deeply. And because of the manipulation and guilting that comes from the operations manager and owner. They didn't show me any emotions or care.

 I took maybe 3-4 sick days in almost two years and NO VACATIONS while I worked there. The operations manager took over a week vacation just the other week... A staycation where she knew we were all suffering immensely with almost no staff. Twice while I worked there. She guilted people into not taking vacations, she made me call and text the poor workers to come in on their day off EVERY FUCKING Week when they were already so maxed out. She wanted me to look like the bad guy. She would talk about them like they are putrid animals who are lazy and don't deserve a break while they are killing themselves for this FUCKING business. When I told that bitch that I had put in my two weeks with the owner, and that no amount of bribing, guilting, begging, pleading, sucking up to, anger, and compliments from him would stop me... I was sobbing and shaking in fear of her. I told her how much I care about them, but how no amount of money he offers me, and how nothing will stop me. I was so sick that I was only functioning on the last bit of strength my body offered me every day. and she looked at me with disgust and a piercing venomous stare that made my blood boil.

 But, I had already been so sick to my stomach shaking and crying, chest pain from my heart racing for so long, and weakness in my body entirely, that I could not stand up to her in that moment. All she said was, "Well can't you just stay for AT LEAST another month? Now ALL of your work is going to fall ON MY SHOULDERS. I'm going to have to hire people LIKE CRAZY." and then she looked at me with anger, rolling her eyes. I was sobbing and shaking the whole time, and I told her how sorry I was for that, but no way. I need to stand up for myself. And I told her that maybe I'm not mentally strong enough for this job, and that I'm replaceable. Didn't know what other approach to take. And she shrugged her shoulders and rolled her eyes with annoyance. And I told her that if the owner were to cut his clients in half, it would make me reconsider. She angrily told me, "Well thats how we make our money." 
I said,  "OK, well I would need things to drastically change if I was to ever reconsider staying at this place." 
Theres no way. Everyone quits so fast. That woman hires people off of the streets. Anyone who's willing to make us to  survive just one more day. 
And then these poor new workers come in with a bright excited smile, and they see me, looking beyond overwhelmed. As the office manager. Along with the few people holding that business together. 

It was a running joke... "just give it to Vivian." the operations manager would say. Just give it to Vivian. Just give it to Vivian, JUST GIVE IT TO VIVIAN. while she piles all of the work on me while she got to leave early every day and go on the road every single week near the end. She'd say," oh it's not like I enjoy going on a the road, going on death calls." As she would attempt to conceal that sly smirk of hers. It is so much easier than being stuck in that building like I always was. This place works for every funeral home in the state, soooo many out of state funeral homes, other countries, the donation companies in this state and many out of state too which I had to do ALL of the death certificates for. I had at least 30 at a time on EDRS. Because I tried to complete all of them on time. I get in trouble with the state if it's not done fast enough. 
And then the Muslim burial funeral home that I had to do all of the death certificates for. I got new death calls from the owner of that place, who treated his families like garbage, who treated my drivers with complete disrespect. I once broke the rules and called him to yell at him about how angry I was about how he treats my drivers when he should be yelling AT ME. THE OFFICE MANAGER WHO DISPATCHES MY FEW DRIVERS on millions of calls. He would steal at least one of the few drivers I had for his all day runs. 
I had to complete all of his Death Certificates within 24 hours of the decedent's death. Meaning, I had to call the doctors and harass them over and over again to sign those stupid death certificates. A lot of the doctors not knowing HOW TO EVEN LOG ONTO EDRS. So I had to teach them. A lot of these death certificates were deaths in King County. I had to get a DA number. A disposition authorization number. Often having to call the medical examiners to get it for me, while I had to send my proof copy of the death certificate vitals after typing them up while I have ten people on hold, a desk FULL of files and papers... A million other death certificates with many other angry funeral homes calling me to yell at me for not making them a number one priority. 

 And calls every second of the day with many specific requests, to do things for every one of the MANY MANY MANY MANYYYYY clients. Some of them were so kind and understanding to me. My friends. But they had to do their jobs too. It wasn't their fault thay I was beyond overwhelmed, sobbing almost every day in the office, trying to contain myself in front of the many clients and families that would call, and my drivers. Some of the clients and families would be so upset because they thought I was slacking on my job... When in reality, there wasn't NEAR enough time in the day. Oh.. There's so much more. I had to dispatch the very few drivers I had to work with, on millions of calls... Planning their entire routes while dealing with much more than what I have explained so far. It was a changing puzzle every minute of the day with all of the calls to deal with on my own. The new death calls that would come in so often, it would make me so angry that I had to put them and every other person on hold to THROW MY PEN AND PAPERS AROUND THE ROOM while I was alone in the building, also while many clients would come into the building with tons and tons of new dead bodies for me to deal with on my own. While having to deal with everything in the office.. And the other millions of death certificates and EMAILS. Emails, emails, emails, emails. Every 5 seconds a new one. I got so used to doing at least 20 things at once and I got so good at it without making mistakes. I was almost flawless. And there was one funeral home who would bring in 4-10 bodies at a time, piling all of the bodies on top of each other... Which is illegal by the way. It was the fault of the funeral directors that made the poor drivers do it. Also the same people who constantly belittled and yelled at me on the phone, and in the emails. The CAPS LOCK they would use for emphasis, directed at me. "I CANNOT DO MY JOB IF YOU DON'T DO YOURS!!!!!!!!!" 

Because the owner and operations manager were too lazy to deal with it,  they made me do it. Something about this job makes you want to kill yourself and sell your soul to save the company. What the actual fuck is this. And your well being. Your happiness. There were always many funeral homes bringing in many bodies one after the other after the other, after the other, while the phone would ring off the hook and I'd have to run back and forth. With the few seconds I had, I would spend time pulling out so many bodies out of the coolers, just to make room for one more and stuff it in there or put it on the floor. Stuff it in there like a sausage. Because I didn't have a damn choice. With how many bodies I've seen, how many overdoses, suicides, illness, covid, hangings, shotgun wounds, getting run over by a giant truck, mother son car accidents, murder suicides, drownings, decomposed bodies, nicely embalmed bodies with sweet families taking care and putting a beautiful hat or earrings, or whatever was meaningful to them, the ones that were dead in their house or the lake for weeks... Months... Eventually I felt no empathy for all of them. It took a lot for me to feel empathy for them after so long of running on almost no energy left. I lost it all. Because of how sick I was, I couldn't bring myself to feel normal human emotions anymore. 
Because I couldn't survive there while also feeling empathy for the deceased. I just had to find a way to find space for all of them on my own in three giant coolers with 700+ bodies, being short staffed, crying, suffering, almost vomiting daily from the stress. Until I had one or two people arrive for their shift to help me. Then I could go to the bathroom and cry in peace. Or go cry with the other few people we had after they had had enough in that building as well. 
The operations manager was absolutely no help until I asked her questions on how to do something because she refused to get up off of her ass to help everyone that was suffering. 

 It hurts so badly that my coworkers are still there, now suffering much worse because I'm not there to protect them anymore. 

OH, also, I used to take death certificates home with me because I got in trouble for not getting all of them done on time. I had an impossible amount to do on my own.. She used to pretend to care about me and not wanting me to do them at home... But eventually, when I asked her again, she said, "it's OK Vivian, I didn't hear that." and just looked at me with approval. The abuse wasn't apparent until I started getting so sick physically and mentally ill that it took sheer willpower to make it through one day before I would collapse and then sit in the corner of my bed in the dark, in my room. Just shaking and crying uncontrollably.

My biggest wish, is for thay business to collapse and fall to the ground. I hope they all get out and survive. Like I finally am now.

Im only 20 but there’s so much happening so fast I don’t know what to do. I’m currently unemployed cause I got hit by 2 cars on my motorcycle and I can’t work because of my injuries. This happened in may and I’m not expected to heal till late december. I have 7k+ in medical bills, no money from disability nor my job, even though I’m on leave there’s a lot of problems with paperwork they need from the state or something. Alongside my medical bills I have my personal bills to pay, I used up my emergency funds on medical bills and they keep rolling in at least 2 a week. Sold my motorcycle, she’s, jewelry, taken extra money from savings and boy I just want to die. No money, no job, no people i can talk to about my problems. Lord I pray everyday I could just get a simple job to keep up

Post 416: Stress almost took me out
Content:
So I don’t want this to be too long I just wanted to get  this out to whoever is in a similar situation. Yesterday I got into a big argument with my SO and I was absolutely furious and just confused by their actions and words. She blames me for almost everything and yesterday I got so stressed out and angry that I was rushed to the hospital! I almost had a heart attack and the medic who showed up to my apartment diagnosed me with svt! Which later was confirmed to be heart palpitations! I’m 31 and it was one of the scariest feelings I’ve ever dealt with. I had to bring my one year old daughter with me bc I had nobody to watch her and just not being able to hold her hand threw that all really affected me. But I wrote this all to say that whatever situation you’re going through try not to let that feeling of emotion take over you. I really let this woman bring me to a level i never reached in my life! I’ve never been to the hospital for anything. No health issues whatsoever! So I can almost guarantee that me letting stress and anger get the best of me almost cost me my life. The medic said that if I was up in age I probably would have died because my heart wouldn’t have been able to sustain a rate of 250! So I just want to say to anyone who reads this to do whatever you can to stay stress free and take care of your health. Don’t let anyone control you to the point that I did. I feel like a fool.

Post 418: The mask
Content:
No, not the n95. I’m talking about the mask I wear every day to appear functioning. You know how you see pictures of people who were depressed and they are all smiling. Then the caption reads “ this is what depression looks like.” I get it. I get up in the morning and feel like I have to get through another day but I do it.  I go to work. I smile and laugh with co workers or customers. I make small talk. I put on my manager mask and delegate work and explain that it’s important or have passion in my voice. I lead meetings and inspire my team to “ kill it out there”. Own it! Go team! I cheerlead. Then I turn it off and go back to being me.  FYI my problem is anxiety not depression or at least I think so.  I do the same with family, friends, etc. it’s exhausting. When ppl come over I can’t wait for them to leave so I can stop acting.  The first time I got a job as a teen, my mom saw how terrified I was to apply. She said “fake it. Go in there like someone who would really be a go getter” and I did.  It worked. Honestly I would have no one if they saw the real me.  If I could even find her again. Idk

Post 419: How do you experience stress in your body?
Content:
Hi there! I'm looking for survey participants for my grad school thesis project on the prevalence of different stress responses across the population. Since you are all interested in stress here, I thought you might be interested in participating in the project. Info is below. Thanks so much!

Our laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh is conducting a research study to measure how people experience **stress**. If you are a US citizen or resident between the ages of 18-65 years old, you are eligible to participate! The study involves filling out some questionnaires about how stress manifests itself in your body. Depending on your unique stress response, the survey could take as little as 5 minutes or up to approximately 15 minutes to complete. To compensate you for completing the survey, you can choose to have your name entered for the opportunity to receive an iPad. You may also elect to do the survey as a volunteer without compensation (i.e., without having your name entered to receive an iPad).

Some respondents may be invited to fill out the survey a second time at a later date and will again have the opportunity to receive compensation.

Post 420: How can I better cope with having to work 40 hours a week?
Content:
I’m currently off work with stress. Not just because of work but also because I have a lot going on right now. Being off work I’m still stressing about work though. I just wish I didn’t have to do it. I still can’t accept the idea that I have to do it. I don’t know if that’s because I grew up not having to work while living at my mums that she’d always bail me out. That was a few years ago though now and I’m 32 now with a mortgage and girlfriend, a dog and wedding on the horizon. I do love my girlfriend but I’m scared of the commitment because I feel the further in the rabbit hole I go the harder it will be to have a chilled lifestyle again. I wish I could work part time or not at all. But obviously that would mean a dull existence and loneliness. I’ve done it before but my life has improved a lot now and I don’t want to give it up. I’ve tried taking time off work but the thought of work and other things are just stressing me out still. I got so stressed that I did try splitting up with my girlfriend but my mental state wasn’t right at the time so we got back together.

Post 421: How exactly does stress cause chest pain?
Content:
I recently experienced a lot of stress at work and have been having acute chest pain for more than a week. Since I'm also drinking alcohol every evening to reduce the stress, I thought the alcohol caused the heart pains. So I went to a doctor, to find out.

After a series of tests, nothing abnormal whatsoever was found. Even though I was feeling a strong stabbing feeling in my heart area during the tests.

Normal blood pressure, no irregularities in heart beat, etc...

So it was concluded that it is stress related. But I still don't get it. The pain I'm feeling is very real. It's stabbing me in the heart and sometimes I'm feeling really faint and about to pass out.

The doctor says it can happen with stress. But I don't understand how?? How can my body feel so bad, yet all tests reveal that everything is perfectly normal?

What's the process that gives pain without physical reason?

Does anyone find their body flares up in a stress response at any kind of deviation from equilibrium? 

Even if good exciting things are happening my body gets triggered and I suffer with (sometimes all but not always all at once) headaches, neck pain, jaw clenching, constant butterflies, cough, hives, IBS flare ups, sleep disruption, eye condition flare ups... I just don’t know how to calm it down. 

I do yoga, I journal, I nap if I feel I need to, I try to say no to social events I don’t really want to go to, I take Xanax as and when I need - I mostly just ride it out and try and take care of myself but sometimes these symptoms get in the way of things I need to do! Any tips for getting the body to calm down a bit?

Post 423: I Can't Post Anything Without Getting Criticized
Content:
So basically I made a post on my pizza. I'm still new to cooking but my cooking isn't half bad. But apparently some guy commented thinking it wasn't finished. Before I know it, he message me trying to give me "advice" in the rudest most condescending way. I turned down his offer politely, but he kept insisting with even more of a rude attitude. I told him conversation was over, and he called me weak. So I told him there's a difference between giving tips and being a jackass. Then obviously he took that personally and started to cut deeper with his words more than before. So I just blocked him. Don't know how to undo it because I wanted to add one more thing. This is what I had typed up

"I don't even know what you're deal is. You're just being rude and forcing the idea that you're better at making pizza than I am. You weren't offering kind tips, you were coming in like you're some kind of professional critic. I don't need to change to satisfy you, I like my pizza the way it is. If you can't respect that then that goes to show what kind of person you are."

I hate confrontation, but I ain't taking shit from anyone. He don't like the look of my food, whatever. But the look doesn't shape the taste of it. He can continue wallowing in his ego while I'm just cooking food so I can continue living. I only made the post just for fun, but that'll be the last time I ever post my food online.

To the asshole who ruined my afternoon, I hope you're happy bringing someone's self esteem down. Get a life. And be thankful I'm not using your name, because I could, but I'm too nice to be an asshole like you.

Post 426: Stress on left side of brain, feeling stressed all the time and struggling to find words to speak
Content:
**No, it is not a tumour, I have had MRIs, EEGs etc.**

So essentially, I struggle to find the words that I want to say. I often stutter, and repeat a few words like 2-3 times every now and then. This is over the last few years (currently 23).

I find there are days where my head is completely clear, and I feel like my head is clear of all clutter and can find every word I want to say.

Looking back on these days, I find that I have been surrounded by people I love and am comfortable with. Where I feel accepted. So I do not struggle to say things and can speak freely. The next day I tend to feel amazing and can speak freely as well. The following days, it reverts back to the same tension and struggle to find words.

It would appear that it might be related to me not feeling accepted anywhere? Or not feeling confident?

I am hoping someone has experienced this and knows of any exercises that can relieve this tension and allow me to think and speak freely.

(I eat well, meditate, exercise, have a lovely family, lovely relationship, I do see a neurologist for other reasons and yes I am aware that this could be related but I want to explore simple stress techniques as well, so please please please if you can, just provided some exercises that may help)

Thank you guys so much.

Post 427: UNIVERSITIES REALLY DON'T CARE
Content:
i am sure covid has been extra stressful for everyone, countless people have lost their jobs, their health has deteriorated and I'm sure students can relate that online classes have been extremely stressful.

I do also understand where the professors stand, they had to shift their whole life to sitting in front of a computer to teach to a bunch of unenthusiastic students who won't even turn their cameras on, but, at the same time, we too are overpaying for an educational experience that isn't an experience at all. 

Sitting at our computers all day, rushing to finish deadlines and studying for tests and just staying focused is hard, while managing work that's just the cherry on top.

I do have some professors who have been very understanding and have helped a lot, curving grades, providing extra credit, then we have my stats professor. He bases our grades so heavily on the tests (2 tests and 1 final), I have no idea what grade i have but I know i'm failing along with the rest of my class. I've never done this badly in school ever! I have never failed a class to say the least. Not understanding to our circumstances, as an international student, having to be awake at 3am to focus of math is a feat. I've emailed him expressing my concerns, no reply. And its not just me, the entire class is failing. I have enrolled in the same class with a different professor for next semester in case I do not make it, which I won't unless he curves it a whole 10%. 

The amount of stress that is just waiting to blow up is insane and I cannot do anything to help! My thoughts keep circulating back and fixating on that one thing. How do you guys manage stress and anxiety?!!! Ive tried almost everything

Post 431: Stress is affecting my sleep.
Content:
I have been waking up at 2:30 in the morning in the last two weeks. If I am lucky,  I've slept 4 hours. Then I am up and down for the rest of the night.  Apparently, I am having night terrors where I am fighting and yelling in the hours that I do sleep. I  didn't know that. That generally only happens when I am very stressed out.  Does anyone have any hints on what I can do before going to sleep that will relax me enough to sleep through the night?

Post 434: How do you cope with spiraling? I need help
Content:
Everytime i think about work, i start to get blocked and start to spiral with anxiety. My brain just starts to get so stressed i start to get disturbing intrusive images that will make me go get distracted so i can stop having them, but that doesnt make any of my work disappear, so of course that will make me accumulate work and then have to either work for weeks without rest or have a breakdown and fail on my projects. When i overwork myself, its to a point where i will need to rest for several days after, which can make me go to the ''get distracted and avoid doing work'' phase because my brain just doesnt want to go through several days like that again. But then works gets accumulated, and it happens again. There is no inbetween, im not able to work bit by bit and get organized because my brain is actively fighting against me.

I guess my question is how to not get blocked? How do i stop this cycle of distractions, rest and then punishment?

Post 435: Work has been stressful all year
Content:
I’m a postman and most people think of it as an easy going job. It was once that way many years ago but it was privatised about 15 years ago (Royal Mail). I know I’m not the only one struggling at the minute. But I feel like I’m doing so shit compared to everyone else. With absences cause of covid and everyone ordering for Christmas it’s been a nightmare often working 50 hour weeks from a usual 28. It’s not even only that but I am pretty sensitive type and I feel like I’m fucking up more than anybody else. When I feel useless at something I just want to give up. It’s only my girlfriend pushing me through at the moment. I know it’s childish to just want to quit when things go wrong but I feel on edge atm. I’m going to end up letting down a lot of customers who are waiting for their parcels because I’m not quick compared to the others

Post 436: Can you be stressed without even knowing it
Content:
Hey everyone I am just curious can you be stressed or anxious without even knowing it. For example for the last 3 weeks I had this tingling feeling around my chin and bottom lip. So I did the number 1 no no and googled it, well according to google I might have advance cancer and dying in less then a year. That caused me to stress out and think what if I am not around for my kids to see my kids grow up. So I called the doctor and I have an appointment with him on Tuesday but he sent me to get a blood test in advance which all came up perfect except for cholesterol levels. So after the blood test results I think my anxiety lowered but every often I still feel the chin tingling. So back to the question can you be stress or anxious on something without realizing.

Thanks for the advice


Just an update my doctor doesn’t think my chin is anything even though I still feel the tingling feeling even now. He said give it another month and then we will go for an mri.

Is it possible that stress of me worrying has been causing this symptom and if so it cannot be healthy having stress symptoms for like a month

Thanks for the advice

Post 438: Over the years have developed a Pavlov-esque stress reaction to just multitasking at my computer, typing, sending emails, etc...
Content:
Very busy and stressful job leads to head pressure, anxiety, severe tension, then detachment...not good. And I’m just working from home! Can’t figure out how to fix this. The multitasking triggers the head pressure and then spirals from there. It lasts even through the weekend and has long term effects. Meditation  helps but only very temporarily. After a long vacation it’s better for a while then slip right back into it. Strange... it’s such a tense high blood pressure-like feeling as if what I’m working on has life or death consequences...when it’s just regular financial work. Tell myself to not care as much but I don’t even think it’s that... the work/laptop take me to that stressful place no matter what I’m working on.

Post 439: Easily stressed
Content:
So I get stressed quite easily and find it difficult to cope with pressure and difficult situations. 

I also find that when such stressful situations happen I tend to blame myself for them and get really down and negative about myself. I get quite worked up about it that sometimes end up having mental breakdowns and let it all out by having a good cry. 

I don’t know what to do to be more resilient and deal with it better so it doesn’t affect me so much because it’s affecting my mental health and making me feel worse about myself.

Post 440: Can’t find a uni work and life balance
Content:
Im a first year student who is adjusting to independent living. I find just walking to the shops and getting essentials soul draining when I see the amount adding up and I accidentally bought out of date broccoli. I try to keep a balanced diet because I know I become sluggish if I don’t but cooking is so time consuming and shopping for meat, veg, headache tablets, toilet paper etc feels like putting a hole in my bank account and the time spent shopping could have been spent working. In some ways it makes me feel accomplished, not like a man child who just lives of instant noodles and take aways. There are moments when my brain is drained and I just watch Netflix which makes me feel really guilty. I’m also making a film with a group in my film studies course and I’m the script writer which is a lot of pressure, we’re also communicating mostly online because of the pandemic but I don’t know if things would be better if this wasn’t a pandemic... I’m worried that the people I’m working with don’t like me, I’m often the one who’s asking people if they’ve done this and that, what ideas do they have and so on. Because of the pandemic, none of us have even seen the set. On top of that I have to write a pre production piece and read out loud an essay analysing a short story in Creative Writing... I’m doing a joint honours in a degree that’s seen as kind of useless and self-indulgent (the arts)

Post 441: 4 tips to help deal with election stress
Content:
This is a weird heavy time and I know it has been bringing me down and causing so much unnecessary stress. I have begun implementing 4 things to decrease my stress and feel more grounded & mindful.

1. Obviously, we didn't get a clear-cut answer last night and I don't know if we will get one today. So, I have been mentally preparing myself for these delayed results. I have been practicing this DBT technique called "cope ahead." You can do it too! Start by imagining the stressful situation, then identify which coping skills you can use, practice these coping skills, and then rehearse the stressful situation in your mind while coping effectively!
2. Focus on my healthy habits and promote them! Get enough sleep, eat balanced meals, and move your body!
3. Replace scrolling with something nourishing. If going on social media is going to make you feel shitty right now, don't do it then! There are a bunch of people on social media just poking the bear and the uncertainty right now might just make you feel more anxious. I am opting for a book and a glass of wine over scrolling on Twitter.
4. Try to focus on the positive and look for signs of hope... (eye roll). But seriously. It's super easy to be negative during shitty times, but looking for peace throughout the day, writing a gratitude list, or simply smiling can boost your mood and decrease stress!

Remember you are important and need to take care of yourself right now. What you are feeling is valid, so show yourself grace and be compassionate to yourself!

Post 442: How has stress changed for us since our ancestors? Talking chronic stress w/ Dr.Sonia Lupien- Hashtag Health Podcast
Content:
**HH:** I'd like to touch a bit more on the evolution of the stress response and how it evolved versus how it's being activated today. Would you say that we're more stressed than our ancestors were?

**SL:** Many people ask me whether we are more stressed than our ancestors were. Well, they had different stressors than we had because in order to answer this question, it is highly important to distinguish between two types of stressors: absolute and relative stressors

An absolute stressor is a real truth for everyone. For example, someone comes in my house and says, FIRE!. And we're not going to start talking, I'm going to start running and get out of this house to save my life. So this is an absolute stress. Now we have a problem because we don't have a lot of absolute stress, nowadays in our countries.

We are in very rich countries, educated, healthy. And yet, the world health organization predicts that by 2020, which is now, depression related to chronic stress, will be the second cause of invalidity in the world after cardiovascular disorders that are related to stress. Well, this didn't make sense for us scientists because in the entire history of humanity, humans have never been in such high level of security. There's no more mammoths! You know, there's no more big, you know, animals chasing us. And yet many, many of us are suffering from stress. And we now know that it is because these stressors that surround us now are relative.

My hobbies used to make me feel better, peaceful, and feel like I have done something great for the day. But it has changed, when I dont do my hobbies for a few weeks, I start to feel stressed and anxious. I can't think of anything else, I can't concentrate, and I try to stay away from things that might remind me of my hobbies as if it's some kind of trauma. I'm wondering if there's someone out there like me, that's why I'm posting this. But it would be great if you'd give me some advice as well.

Post 445: My understanding of stress, anxiety and worries ...
Content:
 So I have read books on anxiety and worries and also read about it online trying to find solutions. Here I have presented what I feel about these three things. I am not a medical expert but here I am just sharing my views. If it helps anyone I would be happy.

First we need to understand this stress anxiety and worry.

Stress and worry are not always bad. For eg, if you are stressed at the right level about your exams you may actually study more than you may have studied if you were not stressed out. Remember the one night stands before exams that students sometimes do to pass school exams (cramming like this does not work in the long run). Same goes for worry, worry in the right amount will make you prepare well for the situation you are worried about. For eg, if you are going on a camping trip and you are just worried at the right level about your preparation, you will make sure you prepared well. But if you get excessively worried, which is exactly what according to me is anxiety, unnecessary worry, you may end up cancelling the plan altogether. 

So the aim should not be to avoid stress or worry completely but to manage it well and keep it under a certain level so that it does not become excessive. 

How do you know that you are having excess worry or anxiety(excess worry)? It is simple enough, when you do not perform any action, and instead waste time in overthinking, you are over stressed and anxious. The right level of stress and worry never stops from performing a task or action towards the thing that is worrying us or stressing us. But if we are over stressed or excessively worrying, we get stuck in the thinking loop and never get to action.

So we need tools with ourselves in order to fight this excess stress and anxiety. There are two types of tools we can use for it, first are the one that will make us less susceptible from going towards excess stress and anxiety in general. These include exercise/yoga and mindfulness. For people who cannot perform exercise they can go for meditation or other things like guided imagery. These are the tools that we need to do everyday. Their benefit will build up over time and to maintain that we need to keep up with these tools no matter what. 

Second type of tools we need include the ones which we will use when we feel that we are under excess stress or anxiety. First thing to be done in these cases is belly breathing deep and slow breadths for as long as we feel comfortable. Then we need to write down or type the worry or the stressor. And instead of thinking in loops in our head we have to write or type whatever we think about it. Writing is literally very therapeutic in these cases because what happens that sometimes a small issue becomes so big in our head that we do not realise how small it is. So to avoid that, it is better to materialise it in the form of text. That I can say from my experience will also prevent the thought looping in the head.

Other than this, in order to manage worry well in general, I have created a very good system. Whenever you get a worry, see if it is related to present, if it is, deal with it right now in the normal way, and if it gets excess, you know what to do. If it is not and can be delayed, simply keep a list where you add it, that list can be a list on phone or handwritten. It simply will give your brain the satisfaction that this worry will be taken care of later for sure so right now it can focus on important things. Then look at that list in the evening and again think whether you can delay the worries in it, the ones you cannot delay just handle them right now and the ones that can be delayed, just delay them and look back at them on Sunday morning.

Sometimes what happens is that you look at that worry on Sunday and you would feel like "Eh, this is not a worry at all for me now."

Post 446: Follow up: I created a chatbot to help people with anxiety and stress
Content:
A while ago I posted about a [chatbot](https://www.iamfeelinganxious.com/) that helps in difficult moments like anxiety, stress and panic, many of you seemed to find it helpful.

After many of you mentioned some of the anxiety symptoms can be hard to differentiate from coronavirus related symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations are just 3 examples), we realized intense anxiety can, in some cases, cause similar symptoms to COVID-19, creating confusion, often leading to even more anxiety. So we made a [comparison](https://www.pocketcoach.co/blog/anxiety-vs-coronavirus-symptoms/) of the symptoms, as well as techniques to help you differentiate between anxiety and the coronavirus.

Post 447: Is thinking about "worse case" scenarios an unhealthy way to deal with stress?
Content:
For example, I find that thinking of people that are in worse conditions than myself, reminding yourself of death, and other morbid things that are going on in the world gives me perspective of life. It makes me ask myself (e.g. is this stupid job or person really worth my mind exerting effort to stress over) when none of this really matters in the end

Post 448: Start doing nothing for a few minutes a day
Content:
Since, childhood we're almost forced to do something all the time whether it's studying, playing or trying to socialise and when we go through teenage things get worse. You have your first crush, relationship and breakup. So, you think and you think a lot all the time. Then you go for a job, with or without college degree and now you have to worry about money, career and what not. You're on your own. Now, you think a even more. And the worst part about all of this is that this is a story of every normal person who didn't face any major issues in life like disability, divorce of parents, death of an immediate family member or any other horrible problems one could face.

All of this overthinking can result in complacency about every aspect of life, headaches, not trying anything new, insomnia and worse situation can be that you can go into depression. [To read more about how depression is distributed amongst different age group and how it can affect rest of your life, I would highly recommend this Business Insider article.](https://www.businessinsider.in/science/depression-among-gen-z-is-skyrocketing-a-troubling-mental-health-trend-that-could-impact-the-rest-of-their-lives/articleshow/68505568.cms)

## Precaution is better than cure

In 2018, I was in depression and not because of relationship issues or anything. It was just because of a tiny habit of overthinking everything which I developed when I was 13 and it became cancerous by the time I was 22 years old. Self-doubt or some minor insecurities which I considered to be something that I didn't care about but they used to manifest themselves at the time of taking action. I had all kind of suicidal thoughts. Think of 22 years old me like A.J. from the show "The Sopranos by HBO", but I had a job and I was perfectly socialising. Anyway, I didn't take any drastic step because while I was commuting and listening to one of the episodes of "The Minimalists Podcast", they talked about how they controlled their anxiety which was simply by taking 6 controlled deep breaths. I kept doing that every day whenever I felt anxious or depressed. And that was apparantly, extremely helpful. Fast forward to 2019, when I started working out in the gym, it felt like meditation because I was so focused on lifting heavy weights, doing 100kg squats that all of my muscles and nervous system used to focused only one thing.

If overthinking, depression and anxiety are like high pressure water flowing through pipe and taking 6 breath was like applying tape on a pipe when it starts leaking, then working out in the morning acted like repairing and replacing those pipes everyday. That seemed to work great but after about 6 months I realized that I still hadn't fixed the issue which was that unnecessary high pressure water stream. I started exploring about meditation and mindfulness. It started with 3 minutes a day and I'm now at 20-30 minutes a day. This is wonderful. Now, I have the control of the knob to lower the pressure of stream of thoughts that is flowing through my brain. I not only feel the difference in my thoughts but also the outcomes of my actions and my response to those outcomes if they happen to be unfavourable.

Post 449: Stress / anxiety from workplace disagreements.
Content:
Sorry if this is too minor for this subreddit, but I would really like to get other people’s perspective. 

Brief background, I have struggled with quite significant anxiety, and resultant relatively minor depression over the last decade or so. I am on medication now after having been signed off work for a month a short while ago. 

Recently I have felt very resilient, and enjoying the challenges of work for the first time again in years. 

I have had the strength, and inclination to put myself out there a bit more at work, and to have my voice heard on issues and disagreements where I genuinely feel like I know better or have something to add. 

This has then led to disagreements that make me feel uncomfortable and anxious again. 

They are probably minor things to normal people, but I can’t help but let them get to me. And once I start to fight for something I struggle to let it go which makes things worse, and then I feel worse. 

My instinctive takeaway from these experiences are that I should not speak up, and I need to just be passive and let others dictate as that seems to be the only way I can handle it and not cause the situations that cause my anxiety. 

Does this make sense or resonate with anyone else? 
Am I just wrong? 
What’s the best way forward? 
I just want to be happy and calm in life.

Content:
I don't think I've ever been this stressed before. My wife is long term ill so I am acting as a carer, we have two children under 5 so I'm doing my best for them while holding down a full time job (which I hate more than I can describe) and using any free moments to work on setting up my own business to try and improve my mental state. We reopened at work yesterday and it was insanity, I was angry to the point of shaking over the slightest thing. I woke up this morning with a pain in my chest and neck. If anyone has any advice I'd greatly appreciate it.

Post 452: How do I come back from a joke gone poorly?
Content:
I’m too lazy to make an alt acc or whatever. Last night I went to dinner with some of my coworkers who I was becoming pretty good friends with. I’ll say this now, I was a little under the influence. Over the past few weeks I’ve been dealing with financial struggles, the passing of my grandpa, who was my last grandparent alive, and not being able to leave my house and go hang with other people. Back to last night, things were going okay and we were all having fun, I think. My one pal and I always crack, I guess you could say, “edgy” jokes. He was like “Oh yeah btw guys, (me) is a violently racist person.” It took me a good 30-45 seconds to realize what he said and all my friends were like “(me) what the fuck dude, are not gonna say anything?” I tried to explain that I infact wasn’t and that it was a joke, but it was too late. 

About 5 min later we were still cracking jokes and we were talking about our newest coworker (she wasn’t with us). My edgy friend asked what ethnicity she was and I said she was African American, because I genuinely thought she was, even though I’ve only interacted with her like 3 times. My very liberal manager got up and said “dude are you fucking retarded?” She had never said something like this to me before so I was caught off guard. My mind was scrambling and I was thinking, “Ok, what is she then? She has to be one of the other ones [ethnicities]” Well my stupid monkey brain said “Oh one of the other ones” out loud and everyone just looked at me. At this moment I knew I was fucked and there was no way of helping myself. Over the next couple hours most of them didn’t really talk to me at all and I could tell that they were genuinely disappointed in me and I felt all of this guilt engulf me. 

I sent a long message in our group text and only one of them responded saying “yeah man, the stuff you said rubbed us the wrong way and we are not the audience for that.” After that they have yet to talk to me and I have to go work later and I can’t get myself to cheer up at all. Do you guys have any advice. 

TL;DR I made a ignorant and slightly racist comment while under the influence at dinner with my coworkers and they are very angry at me and aren’t responding to my apologies.

Post 453: Stress/burnout breakdown thanks to my job
Content:
I'm  the introspective and analytic guy so, sometimes, I like to do my job   alone, without the interference of others, and sometimes, when I   interact with people, at the end of the day I feel exhausted.

I   work in a digital agency for a little more than three years. In the  last year, before became de leader of my team, I've been the employee   who worked a shift of 12 hours long, but I loved of what I was doing,   taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on, without so   many meetings. Recently I became the coordinator of my team, so I have   to take care of 7 people, plus over 50 clients. And since the beginning   of the year all I'm doing now is doing meetings with current and new   clients, leaving my team aside. I feel responsible for a lot of mistakes   they've been doing, since I can't take a closer look at them because  of  all these meetings. Sometimes these meetings start at 9 a.m. and end  9  p.m., one after another, lunch in front of the PC was really common  (or  not eating at all). Besides that, I've been disliking the way the   company is being managed, since a new COO is in charge.

My   worst breakdown came when I was talking with my new employee, showing   to him a few things about the company, and seeing the messages in my  whastapp, skype and e-mail coming up all at once, feeling really   overwhelmed. When I finished speaking with this new employee, I called   to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot.

Besides   all that the corona virus situation makes me feel bad too. I've been fearful that I contract this and let my parents sick too (both 70+). So I'm really concerned with them, while them don't believe in anything of   what's happening.

For the past 30 days I'm having a breakdown, so working is being really difficult. For these past days I'm feeling:

* restless
* heavy chest
* couldn't sleep (or sleeping really late so I could enjoy more time away from work)
* I woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry
* crying really, really easily
* questioning about my work and myself
* isolating myself
* easily forgetting any information
* walking up and down in my house with a blank mind, feeling anxious

I   asked for a vacation so I could rest a little, hoping that I could  feel  better. I even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so I  could rest and don't think about them. But I'm in the last day of my  vacation and can’t see an end to feeling this way. I've been thinking  about changing careers too, so I don't have to speak with clients.

I   tried to speak with the CEO and the COO about that, but all they did   was opening an excel table, write down a few solutions (none of them was  good) and asking for me for a solution. There was no empathy to my  feelings.

I don't know what this  feeling is (burnout maybe?) and I don't know what to do. Should I quit  my job and rest for a while? Should I change my career to another one  that I don't need to talk with clients? Is there any other way to handle  this?

Recently I started getting a psychological support, but still this feeling doesn't go away.

Ps: Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

TL;DR:  I'm really introspective and I think because of my job as a team  coordinator, having to talk to a lot of clients, going through a lot of   stressful situations (like averting cancellations), it's making me feel  really down about my work and myself lately, and I don't know what to  do or how make this feeling go away.

From Monday I am going to stop working more than 8 hrs a day. I work from home due to Coronavirus pandemic.

I am a Software Engineer, so I work with computers everyday and that also adds lot of stress looking at the computer monitor all day.

I try to do yoga as much as I can
 But last 2 months I didn't do any due to Insomnia and stress due to work.

So any advice? It irritates me even to work...

I just don't get why he won't freaking go to the doctor, his GP or a Psychiatrist, and address his freaking anxiety! He has ADHD and is Asperger's/Autistic.

We've been cohabiting for 2 years now and this entire time I've been handling every thing. Paying bills, setting and organizing Appointments, freaking talking to people for his or our accounts because he's too anxious for it, picking up the chores he started but won't finish because his friends pop up on Discord and want to play so he doesn't want to keep them waiting or else they will leave. And if I don't help and his anxiety increases I have to deal with the freaking meltdowns! 

I'm just tired of it today, yo. Now I don't even feel like continuing my much needed cleaning and organizing planned for our home today. I love him, but absolutely hate his anxiety and his refusal to get help.

Things were going well for the first month, I struggle a lot with stress at work, holding myself to high expectations, and inability to deal when I mess up, but was using this opportunity to focus on changing my internal thoughts re: work. Then COVID-19 hit and I started working remotely, it went well at first but the last two weeks a lot has been happening in my personal life and I feel stressed to that point that I can barely function, much less focus on work and it’s hard being at home and unable to separate my work life from my personal life. This week it finally got bad enough that I talked to my boss and coworkers about it, as I know my ability to work has suffered. I make lots of small mistakes, forget things, have constant headaches, can’t remember what I’ve done, etc. My brain basically feels like it’s broken. My boss said to be easy on myself, but to make sure that I’m doing good work and contributing value to the organization, I know she cares that I’m struggling but also has high expectations. She’s frustrated and I am too, but I’m truly at a loss of what to do. It’s a small team so asking to take on fewer responsibilities doesn’t seem like an option, and I’d feel selfish doing that so soon into my new position, but I don’t feel like I can keep doing this. Any advice? Either for helping with focus or talking with my boss. Thank you!

Despite the virus shutting everything down, my wife wanting a divorce and having to stay under the same roof (thankfully we are civil), transitioning out of Active Duty while still being a reliable leader, and a toddler being a toddler; my biggest stressor is my messed up (potentially dislocated, not sure) shoulder, and keeping that, “I’m the strongest, invincible Dada!” while playing with my kiddo. Otherwise, I’m keeping it all together!

Post 460: I suddenly developed a tic?
Content:
So I've always been an easily stressed out person and I'm used to just silently dealing with it, but recently I've been REALLY stressed. I started a new job during the pandemic and I've had to keep up with my final projects while schools been cancelled and due dates suddenly being shortened. 3 days ago my sister was talking to me sbout the virus and I suddenly started slightly tilting my head. It happened a few times the first day and its just progressively gotten worse. Working on final projects and getting really frustrated would cause me tic attacks. I honestly don't know how to deal with this, I've been trying to convince myself I've somehow made it all up and im doing it on purpose??? 
Has anybody else dealt with this before and or does anyone have some tips to help stop it? It's been really distracting and frustrating to deal with at work. I haven't done deep research about, but on the surface I havent been able to find all too much about bow or why I suddenlg have a tic??? Basically im just confused and idk how to deal with anything right now.

Post 461: School stresses me out so much
Content:
I don’t understand how I’m expected to take and do really well on all these tests to get into college. The SATs are stressing me out so much because I have to get my score up, especially my math score, and I have NO time to study and the SAT is in two weekends. I come home with hours and hours of homework and I don’t get it done till the time I go to bed. 

I still have to take the ACT and I’m delayed on that because I’m so fucking busy. In May I have 3 AP exams just so I can get college credits. On top of all this I have to keep my grades up but I haven’t been doing well this marking period because I’m so fucking stressed. I don’t understand why people don’t see the issue with this... school, collegeboard, or whatever do not help and overlook the stress that me and my school mates face everyday and how we never have time to do shit and lead a healthy lifestyle.

I just can’t believe how money can make you stress so deep in your core because you have shit to pay for but you have no money to pay for it. I just don’t have what to do. I work and I work and I work but I still don’t have enough money for anything

Post 463: Stress is bizarre
Content:
This is the first time in my life I’ve had to deal with real stress.  I’m 17, and am leaving for a 5 month volunteer program in two days.  I have to fly across the country on my own, where I’ll meet the group of strangers who I’ll be spending the next five months with.  This on its own is very, very stressful.  I have social anxiety, and I’ll have to leave my family (the longest I’ve been away from my parents is a week).

But because I’m leaving in early January, this meant finishing all my classes early.  I barely studied over the winter break.  I did two tests today, which I think I did okay on.  But I have all my exams tomorrow, plus another test.  I’m screwed.  I’ve been trying to cram all the information I can into my brain, but I feel too fatigued and strained for any of it to even make sense.  And I just discovered a new unit of material in the study guide my teacher gave me, which I didn’t even know existed until now.  And that’ll be a big chunk of the EXAM tomorrow.  I’m bound to end up with a very poor grade, which is in biology, the path I want to pursue in university.  How the hell can I imagine getting into university if I can’t even do okay in the high school class?

I only identified the issue I’ve been struggling with as being stress a couple days ago.  I said before then “ugh I’m stressed out” and whatever, but I didn’t know what that really meant until now.  It took a while for me to link the racing mind, insomnia, gastrointestinal troubles, racing heartbeat, restlessness, diffuse concentration, low cognitive performance, disorganization, forgetfulness, and low immune system as all stemming from the same issue until then.  I never would have thought these could possibly be related, until I looked up “symptoms of stress” out of curiosity.  Damn, every one was bang on.  Crazy.

Post 466: Do people still use stress balls and the like to relieve stress?
Content:
I deal with an extreme amount of stress on what seems like a daily basis. When I was younger, I remember that I was given a squishy stress ball that I could squeeze in my hand for when I was in special help for my ADHD. It helped ground myself a little and I'm thinking it can help me in moments of extreme stress. 

Does anyone still use stress balls or similar equipment? Do you recommend using them, and what do you use?

Edit: minor clarification

Post 467: Is it stress, or is our relationship dead?
Content:
My fiancé is constantly stressed about work. For at least the last year. He’s so stressed that he throws up in the mornings and has work related nightmares and sleep shouts. He hates his colleagues, his work and he comes home in a foul mood. I try my best not to take things personally but he’s lost all interest in me and pushes me away. Both emotionally and physically. His excuse is always “I’m tired”. He tells me he loves me but then dismisses me if I have an opinion or request or any interaction with him. He used to be sweet, sending me cute selfies and giving me compliments. Now our interaction is mostly food related. Unless it’s the weekend in which case we’re probably arguing. I’m exhausted fighting with him. He says hurtful things which make me think this relationship is dead, like “just when I thought this relationship was going to work you start another fight”. Also his lack of desire to plan our future, our wedding, our children. Instead it’s, “I’m tired” “you only want kids because your friends have them” “I can’t plan ahead, it gives me anxiety”. 

I don’t know what to make of it. How much is stress and I just need to be more understanding, and how much is just him not really wanting the relationship anymore...?

Post 468: I feel like my body shuts down when dealing with constant stress- to the point where I start shitting blood (warning- details get kinda gross)
Content:
I'm 19 f, I work full time at Starbucks and do 16hours as a graphic design major in school. I have never gotten enough sleep and my personal life is a constant stress too. Last year around the same exact time (approaching finals week) I started getting physical consequences from stress. I went to many doctors and was tested for many things, all coming back negative, yet all confirming that I have serious issues. Here are my symptoms: I'll have constant severe stomach pain, so bad that it's hard to get out of bed other than to rush to the bathroom. My stool is watery, clear mucus that sometimes has very small hints of blood in it- and no it's not from wiping too much.  And it's also very hard to shit when I need to. I have full body aches and of course constant fatigue. I've also had experiences where it affects my period- I had a pms cycle last 2days, completely stop for 3 and then start again. Doctors all have no definite answer other than I'm just stressed. I just want to know why my body can't handle stress like the majority, or if anyone else experiences something similar/ advice? I'm miserable my symptoms stop completely once school ends and or slows down and I thought I was over that horrible part of my life but now they're coming back and I don't know what to do.

I work a full-time job, and it is quite stressful at times by itself. Yesterday was a day of technical difficulties all day. I ended up going into the office (I usually work at home). 

I’m trying to start a side business, really a full time business if possible, aside from my job to make more money. After work, I work on that. So, essentially, I probably work 60 hours a week. I know it could be worse, and I do enjoy it.

I guess it’s just financial and personal stress, but I don’t sleep well even with sleep medicine. I’m just tired, and then I feel guilty for relaxing. I could be working to make more money.

Post 470: I involuntary committed my sister

I’m so stressed out, my sister has a diagnosed multiple personality disorder and has been on a bender for 6 days. I went to the hospital and was able to get the paperwork in order and signed, I had my family and friends behind me except for my father. My sister was picked up by the local police brought to the local emergency room and she sat there for an a evaluation for approximately 36 hours. Within that 36 hours she made multiple phone calls to all of our family members saying “how dead we are to her “. Now this is been said what times and I can count on it I said before my father wasn’t in on it.

About 8 to 10 weeks ago my father and I were going to place my sister on a Section (MA)  and then he chose not to. Now my father who I always confided in is the pissed that I did that and not speaking to me. I’m still dead to my sister ( I have a seizure disorder and just had a grand mal recently ) so thanks.

Post 472: This Year has been a Sh*tShow
Content:
Where to begin.

1. Found out a "friend" has been backstabbing me (which i already sorta knew)
2. Had a(n ex) coworker threaten his life and the wellbeing of others (while he is gone now, the stress of him randomly showing up still lurks)
3. Rough 8 months of a relationship, with a guy I really love; he is struggling with his life, and it has affected my life (we are working on it and the past month has been okay, but the stress of the last 8 still linger).
4. Guilted into a family vacation I didn't want; I had fun, but everything before and after was just hell.
5. My cat has been on and off sick all year, and it is destroying me financially.
6. I have been led on by a corporation for a "real job", only to not get it (I had three interviews, they suggested I had the job, and then they didn't even bother to call me \[i called them!\] to tell me I didn't get it)
7. Got rejected from a "real job" because I had a Master's (remember that lie we grew up with? Degrees get jobs? BS)
8. Political and environmental shit has been staying up at night
9. Had a friend block me on everything because we had different opinions on how the police issue in AMerica should be handled; she wouldn't even talk it out with me. Now I'm a "horrible person" even though she didn't get the full side of my opinion.
10. My mom revealed she is going to cheat on my step-dad. I cut her out of my life, cuz I'm sick of her self-sabotaging and insensitive bs; she is making me pay, literally, by demanding money I owe her from something she gifted me months ago. She doesn't even need the money; she's rich. She is doing it out of spite, and sending me harassing mail.
11. My car was broken into last night.
12. Got into a fight with a friend about her ignorance on the topic of mental health; it's not like I have a degree in it or anything.... oh wait. I do. Things have been awkward in the friend group for the last few months because of it.
13. Had family members lose their homes due to tornadoes 

I honestly am not okay. My mental emotional health has been terrible this year. Yes, I am getting help.  NO, it isn't working. I don't see the point in staying in a world that's basically falling apart.

I'm just after some kind words from people who have been through a similar situation. 

I graduated from design school when I was 18, got my diploma. Managed to get an average design job for a few years - I enjoy design, I'm very creative. After a year and a half at this job I end up moving to the other side of the world with my now ex girlfriend. 

I couldn't get a job within design there because of language difficulties. My gf told me I need to keep working on my portfolio, but was too lazy/ had no inspiration. 

I managed to get a job working at a crap company in retail and have been there for a year - going nowhere.

I also managed to get a tattoo apprenticeship at a small studio - I was there for a year, I was doing really well - until I had a disagreement with the owner and I left. I enjoy tattooing but I'm so impatient, I want things to move quickly and become pro asap...

I've now broken up with my gf of 5+ years and have decided to move back to the other side of the world to start again. 

I have so many jobs/ professions in my head that I want to get into but I'm unsure as to what it is.... I'm so stuck! I feel like a failure. I just want a job that I'm happy at, make good money etc

I understand this is a fairly confusing post but if anyone has any advice on how to better focus on what kind of job to get into - I'd be greatly appreciate it! 

Thanks

Post 477: So stressed that I was really crying about holes in the wall
Content:
Hi everyone just wanted to dump some thoughts out.

So I’m taking organic chemistry over the summer! I took ochem 1 earlier in the summer and managed to get an A, however, I’m in ochem 2 now and it’s REALLY kicking my ass. I’m so stressed about it. Not only that, summer session won’t end until August 15th and my current apartment lease ends on July 31st. My next lease at the new apartment doesn’t start until August 23rd & they won’t let me move in early.

Therefore I had nowhere to stay for the two weeks of August and I didn’t have a friend that had room available for me to crash at. I booked a hotel last minute with my roommate (she’s in the same situation bc she’s taking ochem 2 as well) and we have to move out in a few days.

So now I’m stressed about moving out and making sure everything is in tip top shape so I can get my deposit back right. I’m also stressed because I won’t have room in the hotel for all my stuff and I wouldn’t want to have it sitting in my car for so long. I’m racking my brains trying to find people to ask if I could store some stuff at their place. I also have my ochem 2 exam on Monday and I’m barely grasping the concepts. Not only that, my depression has been creeping back due to some repressed trauma resurfacing so it’s just made everything ten times harder and honestly just more magnified.

I was taking everything down from the walls and was using this tube of some paste that my dad gave me to patch the holes from nails/screws. I had already finished patching up most of the holes until I finally read the tube and turns out that it’s not made for walls. I don’t know anything about construction-y kind of stuff so I started freaking out. I guess that that was my tipping point because I was really sitting on my floor having a crisis and crying over holes in the wall. 

Fast forward to now!
I’ve gotten the right paste needed to patch the holes and have finished going over them. In retrospect, everything is just funny at this point. Like I was really sitting there crying about holes in the wall HAHA

Content:
Hey! I am your typical senior in highschool in a Eastern European country known as Romania. I suffer from anxiety and let’s just say 12th grade hasn’t been treating me well. The first half of it I was okay, but after that my mental illness decided to strike and EVERYTHING WENT TO SHIT. My grades have been down and I lost like 14 pounds due to stress ( I was underweight to begin with , but not dramatically like now) I’ve been feeling on edge and having headaches and being fatigued and everyone in the the whole fucking universe expects me to be on top on fucking everything. Thank God my GPA doesn’t matter and I’ve already taken and hopefully pretty much passed with flying colors an entrance exam to the college that I want to go to  ( pray for me tho because I get the official results on Wednesday )otherwise I would be dead by now .I’m going through a hell of psychosomatic symptoms and I ‘ve cried so damn much. I also have a history semestral paper I haven’t studied shit for. Like jack shit. I ‘ve just returned from a huge trip yesterday to take that entrance exam  ( we’re talking 17 hours back and forth) and today the stress is making me incapable of even focusing on reading my notes, remembering them is close to impossible. Can’t wait for the teacher to pester me about how I am underperforming because I fucking am :)))))

The only thing that has been keeping me going is my will. Luckily for me, I’m pretty headstrong for a tiny being under a shit ton of stress. I just want all of this to be over. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my venting session

Post 482: Needing to vent. Can’t sleep because I’m stressed out.
Content:
Today was an absolute shit fuck of a day. 
To preface, all in the past week, my boyfriend and I were told that our roommate is moving out. Which kind of screws us over because we can’t really afford to pay rent by ourselves. We’re looking for a new place, in order to find said new place I need to find a new job. 
Current job today, I worked 10 hours. 2 people got fired for doing stupid shit, and now I have to work more hours to cover the people who got fired preventing me from being able to look for a job. 

Come home today to find out that boyfriend had a great day at work, and got a call from his buddy offering him a better job for more money. 

Proceeded to get into heated argument with boyfriend because he feels like he’s carrying everyone because he makes the most money in the household. He’s stressed because he doesn’t think we’re going to be able to find a place in time before our lease is up because I don’t make enough money and heave never actually “been an adult” and I don’t take risks. 
Granted. I’m 26, don’t own anything. Nothing has ever been in my name. I rented an apartment for one year when I was 22. Moved back in with my parents. Boyfriend doesn’t understand how we’re going to be able to get a place when I have no credentials. 

I’m stressed because he’s stressed and I don’t understand what’s happening. 

I’m not thrilled with my job right now. 
I’m mad because I’m struggling
I’m worried about having to move
I’m stressed about not being able to find a place in time. 
I’m stressed about finding a new job, because all I’ve ever done is wait tables and I can’t function while doing that. 

Fucccccckkkkkkkk. Help? I can’t sleep. I have to be up in 6 hours and I don’t know what to do. 😩

Post 483: Wish I Knew It Is Okay to Speak Up
Content:
As many of you may be aware, there has been an ongoing problem of student suicides on university and college campuses. Many universities have chosen to stay silent of this issue and have not taken enough measures to try to improve the situation and to offer more accessible resources to their students. In light of this problem, I would like to share the following video to everyone as a reminder, again, that it is okay to speak up, it is okay to talk about mental health issues and it is okay to share your thoughts, feelings and challenges. What you think and how you feel - your emotions and thoughts - are valid and important.

Even for just a bit, Wish I Knew would like play a role to help students through providing additional resources and a platform that can reach many and that can be comfortable for many to access.

Content:
I have had a FB since 2008. I was looking through all my 5-8 year old posts and like a ton of them I don't recognize or understand at all. I am scared!

Like I will say something like "I can't believe so-and-so threatened to throw away my shoes!" and I don't recall that AT ALL.

Or I will say something like "wow! The Hurricane Sandy concert was great!" and then I will look up the video on youtube and not recognize the concert at all.

Also, various 'funny' youtube videos that I embed... I don't recognize them at all. I don't recognize the video..its like new to me "I played a pipe organ today, that was awesome" I don't remember ever playing a pipe organ. Was I lying back then to try and sound impressive? What if it was true...shouldn't I remember things I have done when 'hinted' by these posts?????

I am only 31...do I have dementia?! I should at least recognize these things shouldn't I?!

I am stressed all the time due to homework too. I can’t escape stress. School is the only thing I’m good at and it’s killing me. I have no talent except the little intelligence I have. When I do bad in school I have no worth in my mind. Stress is fucking me over. I can’t focus on anything ever which causes me MORE stress. I’m in a vicious circle of stress. I can’t escape.

Post 486: My problem: I have no faith in myself
Content:
I have been the same since high school. I work really really hard for everything, because I am convinced that I won't be able to achieve anything if I put a normal amount of effort in. Throughout high school and college, school stressed me out like crazy. I would spend 10's of hours studying for tests instead of just 2-3 like my friends. It would always take me a really long time because a lot of times while studying I would get stressed and not be able to think clearly. My friends would praise me for being able to spend so much time studying and "being focused". In reality I was going crazy on the inside. My methods worked, got into an awesome university after high school and also have an amazing job right now. 

But despite all that I still struggle with believing in myself. I'm convinced I'm stupid and wont be able to solve problems on my own. This past month I really struggled to finish a project. It caused me SO much stress. I lost my appetite, and lost lots of weight because I was always feeling stressed/bad/sad that I wasn't able to finish the project at the pace I wanted and I wasn't able to solve bugs quickly. I know a lot of times the answer is right in front of me when working on code, but just like when I was studying, my mind gets clouded with stress and I can't think or do anything properly. I dread going to work and  I am not able to properly enjoy life outside of work either. My bf visited me this past week and I couldn't be happy he was there (even though I hadn't seen him in two months) because of the stress I had in my head.

How do I get myself to not be so emotionally tied to work? I can't keep being like this, I know it'll hinder me from being successful. I am currently trying to exercise in the mornings, and meditate for 5-10 minutes.

Anyone else have this problem? How did you deal with it?

It's really just standard-issue big corporation stuff. My direct manager slaps together the scheduling for our dept. at the last minute because she's overworked, and she's overworked because it's cheaper to make her do enough work for 2/3 people than to just open up an assistant position. I'm not getting enough sleep. I'm going off my medication because I can't make the appointments I need; my weekly schedule is a complete dice roll. I've talked to my direct manager, I've talked to the managers above her, I've talked extensively to Human Resources. I've been making it clear that I'm reaching my breaking point since mid-September, but all I get back is the same hemming and hawing about "we're trying, we're under-staffed, we're really trying, promise it'll get better soon." I called off today - and I almost never do that - because I spent all night stress crying, and knowing it's only going to get 20x worse because of the holidays.  


The manager I talked to immediately chastised me for not trying to reach out to them before my stress got to this point, and tried to guilt me into coming in anyway. I've talked to everybody that I'm 'supposed' to like a good little employee, I've been so visibly stressed out and near-tears that other managers have been doing the reaching out *for* me, what else could they possibly want???

Post 488: I can't sleep at night anymore
Content:
So I've always had a stressful life even as a kid but lately it seems to be really building up more and more. I already have a lot of mental instabilities and stress just makes it all worse. I've noticed that every time I get more bad news like a bill I can't pay or work cutting my hours ext I find it harder and harder to sleep. It takes me a very long time laying in bed with my eyes closed before I finally get to sleep and when I do, I wake up every hour or so. The most I've seem to get at once is about 3 hours of 'solid' sleep without waking. 

Because of this I've been more exhausted and unmotivated to DO anything productive in my life or at work. It really takes a lot for me to be active and a productive member of society anymore. I drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks just because I have no energy. > yes I've tried detoxing from my caffeine intake and it didn't help my sleeping any<  I've tried taking sleep aids like Melanin and ZzzQuil and even sleepy tea but nothing really works.  

Post 489: "Hurry Sickness" – How have I not known about this term!? This type of sickness has plagued me for the past 3+ years
Content:
I've had increasing amounts of stress as expectations placed upon me, life responsibilities, work responsibilities have increased more and more. 

[Hurry Sickness (Google Search)](https://www.google.com/search?q=hurry+sickness)

It became impossible to 'relax'! I'd fill up all my empty time with things to do. Yet I'd complain that I was too stressed to do anything else. 

It's a disease... it's toxic. And I didn't know I had this sickness until this week. 

I am sharing this with you so that you might understand what's going on. 

Doing "more and more and more" and being able to multitask 15 things at once... it's NOT a trophy. It's a sign of a sickness.

It's just a shame how oppressive society has become, that its members are encouraged to take on loads of responsibilities to the point of chronic burn-out and redline. 

Post 490: 14 Ways to Cope With It All
Content:
1.	Be resilient.
It’s easier to deal with life if you can adapt to a variety of situations.

2.	Be open minded.
It’s easier to be critical of a situation or a person, especially if those around you are doing so. Don’t let others be a negative influence on you. Keep an open mind and come to your own conclusions and you’ll experience things in a more positive way.

3.	Be yourself.
Other people may have an opinion on how you should handle things, but you have to do what works for you. You know yourself best – have confidence in your ability to handle things in your own way and in your own time.

4.	Keep Laughing.
Keep things from getting too serious by hanging on to your sense of humor. Find ways to have fun, and plan time with uplifting friends -  a good laugh will make you feel a lot better

5.	Meet new people.
One of the best antidotes for feeling down is to go out and meet new people or participate in new activities. You may find that despite your difficulties, there’s still a lot out there to enjoy.

6.	Don’t sweat the small stuff.
A renowned cardiologist’s philosophy for dealing with stress: (1) Don’t sweat the small stuff. (2) It’s all small stuff.

7.	Use the five-year rule.
Ask yourself: “Five years from now, how important will this problem be?” Nine out of 10, the answer is “Not very important.” The five-year rule can keep you from blowing the situation out of proportion.

8.	Talk to someone.
Don’t bottle up your problems. Go to someone you trust and get it off your chest. Sometimes just verbalizing the problem can help you see it in a different light. If things get bad enough, consider setting up an appointment with a counsellor.

9.	Make your escape.
Taking a break can do wonders for your frame of mind. Your escape doesn’t have to be as elaborate as a vacation; a shopping trip, movie, or walk in the park can do the trick.

10.	Let it out.
Release your frustration in a productive way; a hard sporting game, or going for a run, working out, get yourself moving. It can help ease the tension.

11.	Forget about it.
Sometimes you’ve got to say, “This isn’t important enough to give my time to” and move on from whatever has got you down.

12.	Do something nice.
If you find that you are thinking about your own worries too much, focus on someone else who’s dealing with a tough situation. You’ll get a good feeling from doing something nice for him or her, and you’ll forget about your own troubles.

13.	Do one thing at a time.
If your workload seems overwhelming, don’t get discouraged. Take the most important task that’s haunting you, and start on it. Accomplishing even one of your “to do’s” can make you feel like you’re back in control.

14.	Give yourself a break.
Some people create stress by setting standards that are too high to reach. Don’t try to be perfect – sometimes you’ll have to be satisfied with “good enough.”


Post 491: Managing stress at work.
Content:
Stress makes me ill. They do not pay me enough to make me ill. 

Over the years I have stuck to some basic rules. They may already be on /r/stress. Anyway, it is good to share.   

Negative stress is a term I heard used for things that you have no way of controlling/fixing/moving forward. This type of stress is a killer. If you find yourself dealing with negative stress, tell your boss. You don't work for your boss, your boss works for you. It is their job to make sure you can do yours. The higher up in a company someone works, the more people they work for. Delegate your problems upwards. If you can see a way to de-stress your boss - do it! A stressed boss is hard to delegate to.  

Positive stress is facing the challenge of doing things that you MIGHT be able to achieve (at least it is in my vocabulary). Positive stress is still stress, although some people get such a kick from it they actually create stressful situations. Avoid these people. I do my best to see problems as challenges. When you have things to do, and you find the sheer volume or complexity daunting, break the job down. I am talking ticking things off. Lists. For quantity, tick off every time you have dealt with X amount of doodahs. For complexity, break the job into smaller tasks, and tick them off as you go. Starting can be the hardest thing - so get ticking as soon as you can. Remember, you can only eat an elephant one bite at a time.    

EDIT: And never break down your day into hours to tick off. Tick off jobs/qty, not time.


Post 492: I hate them
Content:
There's this event at my job. It's a big event and I've been having a bad time because of it. The stress ive felt in my college thesis doesnt even come close. 

I've got no fucking clue what i am doing. I've been managing speakers. Doing what i can. I hate waking up in terror.

Day 0 of the event (which just means final prep for the event) is tomorrow and im breaking down.

I've been letting out bouts of screaming in the middle of the night. all while trying not to wake up my parents. 

All ive been feeling is anxiety and anger. I hate my job. I hate my coworkers. I hate my workplace. I hate them. I HATE THEM.

The fear that plagues my entire body is killing me. im reaching a breaking point.

This is the first time stress has made me feel all these things. When i get stressed i usually fall back on my hobbies but i don't even have energy for that.

I just need to vent. I don't need to hear that fucking bullshit of "Oh it'll pass soon don't worry". That's in the future. I am in the present. I am here now and I am stessed now.

Hey guys! Have anyone else had physical symptoms from chronic stress? 
I’m a completely single mom that works full time. So stress is just part of it. 
But lately I’ve had physical symptoms to my stress: 
Brain fog 
Heart racing or irregular heart beats 
Chest pain 
Muscle soreness 
Digestive issues 
Headaches and migraines 
0 appetite 

And I’ve been to the doctors and done test after test and everything comes clear and they have told me that it’s because of stress and I’ve had stress my whole life but it has never manifested itself into this many physical symptoms. 

Have yall been through this? And how did you fix it? I’m desperate. 

Post 495: “Just reduce your stress”
Content:
HOW. 
When grounding doesn’t work, breath work, or CBT worksheets.
When vacations aren’t an option.
When every step is excruciating so working out isn’t an option, even if it was POTS takes my heart rate through the roof.
When I can’t sleep due to chronic pain.
Cinema isn’t enjoyable.
Music isn’t either.
The world has gone insane.
My small corner is nuts too.

So how? How do I reduce stress? 

Thank you in advance for any advice!

Content:
Hi. I'm 36f and I've had a stressful 4 weeks triggered by a cancer scare.  Extreme anxiety. I havent slept much and eaten very little. All tests came back clear and so I thought I'd immediately calm down and feel better but I feel only 20% improvement. I still have no appetite and when I do eat my stomach bloats. My pelvic floor is tight so that's affecting my bowels and bladder and just generally causing pain. How long does it take the body to feel normal again?? 

Post 498: Chronic stress and fatigue. Placed ice pack on my chest and had incredible surge of energy and much less stress!
Content:
Some may have heard the benefits of cold plunges, cold showers and cryotherapy. 

I use an app called Welltory to measure my stress levels, heart variability, heart rate and other things. These things can all be measured with you heart beat. 

My stats have been horrible for months! Meditation, music and breathing with help a bit for a short time. 

Well I recent started icing my chest and it's a legit game changer.  My stress that would be at 90% or higher has been reduced to 20-45% my resting heart rate that would be high near 100 bpm had been brought down to 70 to 80 BPM. Overall coherence is much better and my energy levels skyrocketed. 

Here are a few links discussing this topic as well. Hopefully this can help some people here as well!

Post 499: Burnout / Chronic stress | 22M
Content:
Some background: I’m 22M and 3 years ago I started a few companies. I have been working 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM almost every day. I have worked out slept well and thought I took care of myself.

I had a business partner pushing me hard and I started to feel 6-8 months ago that my work wasn’t as fun. Much because he pushed me and called me when I did something wrong.

In August 2023 I moved and packed all my belongings into 2 bags and moved around Europe 1 month. Started to drink more and sleep less. Still worked out, after that I wanted to go to Cape Town and on the airport I drank 2 glasses of wine and started to feel REALLY dizzy. In the gate to board the plane I couldn’t breathe and thought I got my first panic attack ever.

That disappeared after 2 hours on the plane.

Later when I arrived I felt good.

I woke up the next day, drank a cup of coffee and BOOM the Derelazation hit. I dident feel like myself anymore. I went to bed and played there for 3 days and nothing changed. I got more panic and took the next plane home.

Since then I have had these symtoma coming and going:

- headache in neck and front of head (coming and going)
- depersonalised (24/7)
- fautige
- tinitus (came 2 months ago)
- 1 more hour of sleep per day.
- no motivation for work.
- kinda weak hands / not strong grip. But when I workout I have strong grip.
- health concerns.
- sometimes busy vison / blurry vison.

I have been to the doctor and all my tests are fine / scans. They say it’s most likely stress/anexy/depression.

I eat, workout and sleep well.

I haven’t found anyone else here having similar symptoms, is it even possible for me to burnout when I’m this young?

I would love to get some inputs on this and your thoughts. On this and please tips on recovery.

Post 500: My last year and a half have been the most stressful in my almost 50yrs
Content:
*** Apologies its lengthy**** they say the class clown, or the funny person is usually fighting depression. This has been me my entire life always striving to take care of, and make others happy, and to laugh. This last year and a half has been te worst in my almost 50yrs on this planet. First in July of '22 I had to resign from my job of 10 yrs due to political differences in my local government job after a change in director.  Keep in mind i was a 911 operator for 10yrs which is stressful all the time. I came home told my boyfriend that I left my job, and he took off. After I had his back for months while he found a new job supporting him financially for those months. A month and a half after leaving KY job my 28 yr old son lost his battle with addiction accidentally overdosing because he got high and took his sleeping medicationon top of it. Due to leaving my job I no longer had death insurance on him, and had to pay for everything alone.  His father did not give me a dime nor did he help with planning or participate, or lift a finger in anyway.  While awaiting his autopsy, and return of his remains my father got diagnosed with lung cancer. He never smoked, but was a fire fighter in the 70's and 80's. I was so afraid that I would lose him too that I avoided him. I felt like the worst daughter in the world, and my father is my person, and I let him down. I had never seen my father sick ever except when he had back surgery which caused him to retire on disability years earlier. 2 days after my son passed my youngest son was in an accident. He wasn't injured, but it just added to the stress pile that was already a mile high. At my son's memorial my mother made everything about her, argued with the Pastor, and blamed me publicly for his death to multiple people. Not once did my mother ask me how I was feeling or if I was ok. Needless to say we no longer speak I cut her off after 2 straight months of belligerent text messages and berating phone calls. During all this I had to find another job, and participate in job interviews. The new job took off to a really rocky start and didn't help my depression. Several co-workers gave me a hard time because they hated the agency i came from. Riding me for months, after I logged a complaint with upper management it finally stopped. A year and 3 months later and I'm just starting to feel somewhat normal. By no mean am I over it, just dealing, and processing it a bit better. Talking about these things and sharing them with people who can offer support is helping me heal, and necessary for my mental status.

Post 501: Some tips on how to avoid stress
Content:
The best way to deal with stress is **prevention**. (a healthy amount of stress is good and necessary for life, but high stress levels are very detrimental to your health and well-being. thankfully, it is possible to prevent them). 

Here are some things that can help: 

1. **Get to know your own stress.** Stress looks different in everyone. It can present itself in many different ways, including physical symptoms and psychological symptoms. It can also have a myriad of different causes. So, it is recommended to learn to interpret your body's and your mind's personal signs of stress so you can anticipate and detect them as early as possible and hopefully prevent the stress from escalating.
2. **Avoid social isolation and solitude.** While social isolation can make you feel better in the short term, your social support system is actually the biggest protective factor against stress. It is crucial to build it up and rely on it in times of stress. 
3. **Humour.** This is a natural way the body has to fight stress. Laughing is very healthy, it releases endorphines (which combat stress and make you feel better), relaxes your muscles, helps your digestion, etc. Using humour to cope also allows you to take a step back and observe your problems under a different angle.  
4. **Reduce fatigue.** You should aim for at least 7 hours of sleep, but it is not only the length that matters: the quality of your sleep is just as important. Your body relies on sleep to repair itself, which it does primarily in the deeper phases of sleep. Your mind uses the paradoxal sleep phase (dreams) to process psychological stuff. There are many techniques that can promote better sleep. (Weed is not one of them. While it may help you sleep, weed negatively impacts the quality of your sleep and can make it hard to fall asleep without it). 
5. **Take breaks.** Taking regular breaks during work, school or study is crucial to prevent stress.
6. **Exercise.** You've heard this one before, but exercise is among the best ways to reduce stress. Exercise helps you sleep at night and promotes wakefulness during the day. It helps you clear your head and it releases endorphins, which reduce your stress levels significantly. And finally, it allows a break for your mind, which allows you to be creative and think about your problems differently. Forms of exercise like hiking are specifically effective for this as they are very meditative. 
7. **Learn to say no.** This can be difficult for many people, but the best way to do this is to practice in small, inconsequential situations. It will become easier and easier. 
8. **Affront your problems.** Surely you've heard of the fight/flight/freeze response. Well, the fight response is actually the best way to deal with your problems. Any other responses will just prolong your stress. 

I'm currently studying for my final in a class on stress so I thought I'd give you guys a little recap of the best ways to avoid stress. Please feel free to ask questions as this will help me study. :) 

Post 502: Chronic pain(s) from chronic anxiety
Content:
For the past few months, I’ve been dealing with chronic pain that seems to move around my body, primarily in my feet—especially the heels—and deep buttocks pain that feels like it's within the bones. They sometimes switch. Almost never at the same time. 

I’ve undergone numerous doctor visits, countless blood tests, and several scans, yet everything seems to check out okay health-wise. A physical therapist ruled out fibromyalgia but suggested that the pain might be linked to chronic stress and anxiety.

Adding to this, I've been grappling with intense fatigue (not sleepiness) sporadically, which complicates things further.

This has been an incredibly challenging journey, especially because the pain persists and impacts my daily life, making it difficult to walk at times. It's become evident that it's not just physical; it's linked to my mental health. HOWEVER, I have dealt well with my anxiety and do not have almost any anxiety feelings or symptomts for months now. If anything, the pains started after my month long anxiety flare up.

I’m curious if anyone here has experienced something similar—chronic pain seemingly from chronic anxiety or stress—and if so, how did you cope? Did you find any strategies that helped alleviate the pain or manage it better over time? How long did it take and where were the pains exactly in your body ? 

I’m worried that the pains will never go away.

Post 503: Hey, i wish to share a personal experience on stress and how i overcame it. STORY TIME
Content:
Meditation has made a big difference in my life, and I want to share how it's touched me deeply.  
I remember when I first started meditating. Life was stressful, and I was overwhelmed with work and the noisy city around me. Stress and anxiety were always there, making my health and relationships suffer. A friend suggested meditation, and though I was skeptical, I decided to give it a try.  
At first, meditating felt like a struggle. My mind was used to racing thoughts and distractions, so sitting quietly and focusing on my breath was hard. But I kept at it, knowing that change takes time.  
As I practised meditation, I noticed changes in how I handled stress. I became calmer and clearer when dealing with tough situations. Instead of getting lost in my feelings, I could step back and watch my thoughts without judging them. This helped me make better decisions and deal with problems more effectively. I started watching many youtube videos on meditation and today i found the best of them all a true gem that really has changed my perspective. if you wanna watch it here is the link https://www.youtube.com/live/gfkvm6-Tjp4?si=I-x1Oxgtyv7bB\_Ju . I hope it helps someone else like it helped me  
Meditation also had a big impact on my mental health. I had been dealing with anxiety and occasional depression for a while and relied on medication to cope. But with meditation, I started feeling more at peace and content than ever before. It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, and I even needed less medication, which my doctor helped me with.  
My relationships improved too. Meditation helped me become more understanding and empathetic towards others. I became a better listener and communicator, making my connections with friends and family deeper and more meaningful.  
Physically, I slept better, had more energy, and experienced fewer headaches and stress-related health issues. I felt healthier and happier overall.  
One unexpected gift was finding my purpose and direction in life. Through meditation, I gained clarity about my goals and passions, which led me to pursue things that truly mattered to me.  
Meditation hasn't magically solved all my problems, but it has been a powerful tool for self-discovery and personal growth. It has brought me mindfulness, resilience, and inner peace, and I'm excited to see how it continues to shape my life. I'm deeply grateful for the positive impact it has had on every part of my life. Meditation isn't just a change; it's a heartfelt transformation.

Content:
Title says most of it. When I feel I am not doing enough in life while also doing so much I can't get everything done I literally go crazy. I'll laugh. I'll cry. I'll push myself to the limits for hours or for the entire night. I'll blast music in my ears knowing I'm not going to fix the issues. But for that entire night I'm so happy. I really enjoy stress and it's the only place I feel comfortable.

Wondering if anyone else has this same thing or can explain what is happening. When I'm sad/depressed it works the same way as well.

Post 510: Hair graying from stress, then stressed about getting gray hairs
Content:
I'm only 23, got my first grey hair at 20, and it's spreading all over my head at this point. By the time I'm thirty I'll probably be fully white at this rate. 

I think it's due to stress, I still live with my parents and dropped out of school when CoVID hit. 

My stress is ironically all related to age and having missed my college years, feeling like I'm old and wanting to get those years back, and the gray hairs just reconfirm my already negative perception of myself in that regard. 

It feels like a cycle that I'm stuck in, and it only gets worse every day. I feel fucking awful sometimes, watching my life pass away, not living it. I think the isolation for so many years did a number on my psyche, and I have no idea how to recover.

Post 511: How to stop stress eating

Post 512: Neurological Impacts from Stress
Content:
Hey everyone. Looking for a little feedback regarding neurological impacts on the body from stress. I've recently had multiple doctors visits within the past few months regarding some medical issues I'm going through. This includes most nerve pain in Leg and arm and as of recently headaches and some eye pain/visual disturbances and I've seen a neurologist, pulmonary doctor, cardiologist, RA doc, etc. All test to date have come back as normal/healthy with the exception of a deficient Vitamin D level (22) and low B12 level (350). I'm not certain that these things have made such an impact in a way to be going through what I'm going through, but wanted to know more about what impacts stress can have on the nervous system. With everything that's been going on I've been extremely stressed, with worrying about my health majority of the day. Can stress cause prolonged headaches and eye issues? I'd like to hear feedback from others about your experiences and how long you went through this. I'd also like to hear more about how you were able to official rule out medical diagnosis as a concern and rule it all as stress related. Thanks

Post 513: I'm mad and sulking over a single bad date.
Content:
I'm 28. Had 6 dates in my life. Never had sex before. Had 1 bad acquaintance that I needed therapy to deal with.

I don't hate women. I don't think everything is pointless. I chat with coworkers, but I don't have a lot of friends. Ladies seem to think I'm a nice person and funny. I don't have much trouble shamelessly asking someone out. I've long thought I have enough hobbies and interests and goals to keep myself mentally stable and preoccupied. Doesn't stop everyone from saying I'm a sweet guy who just needs to be more confident, less sensitive, and wait for the right person.

I get flustered when I meet someone flirty or shameless, but I play it off with self-deprecation and wit.

I had a date with a coworker who was coming onto me frequently  (poking me, prodding me, talking about bodily functions, giving me looks and signs and thank yous, took my phone number, called me, wishes me morning, acts like she's out of breath around me, talks about and asks me sexual questions, talks about her dating history, etc).

She wanted to go to a Barne's and Noble's. I was 10 minutes late due to traffic and she'd shown up an hour early to give herself a headstart.

She stood next to me, I comically volunteered to be pack mule, and we sat and read books for a while, talking in-between. She made a spa appointment at 4pm. I asked her what she wanted - 1) friendship, 2) casual sex, 3) a relationship. I wasn't good for 2 (no confidence).

She described to me frequently about how much her previous relationships messed her up, we talked indirectly our thoughts about romance and such.

Her answer was 1 and she said she didn't know what the future hold.

We left and I went to a Chic-filet she'd informed me was there. Then I drove home rather than wait the hour for her appointment to finish, said I had fun, and drove home listening to Drowning Pool and Foo Fighters.

I got home, played a video game, laid down, and fought back tears feeling every insecure and negative thought I've had about myself. This date was something I wanted and it felt like I came away with less than I started with. She said she'd text me later and didn't get around to it until much later, and even though it was a short time I felt myself getting lonelier and madder because we just weren't having the initial flirty back and forth we did before the date.

I turned my phone off.

Everyone is going to tell me "there's a million fish" and she even said "some people just don't vibe" but the messages are just so unclear to me right now. This isn't too long after I broke up with someone who I felt like I did vibe with.

I just can't see myself continuing to give this much energy toward meeting someone new another 5-00 times like everybody else. I'm a sensitive person. I feel drained and hateful of everyone that dating comes so easily to even though I know that's wrong. I'm so mad we didn't click its embarassing, and I know it's not her fault. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't feel like exercising or doing anything positive. I just want to be angry.

I guess I walked in expecting she'd throw herself at me, and I'd have the chance to be a gentleman and be like "hey I like you, but I want to get to know you" and she'd be like "ah he's not just a desperate fuck, he has character." And well that didn't happen. Instead I feel like I got read and told politely I wasn't what someone was looking for. And any attempt at friendship on my end will be a desperate act.

I could be entirely wrong. 

I would have liked if we'd hugged at the end or made additional plans. She agreed to doing something in the near future but I didn't get any excitement out of it. Optimistically I want to say we could probably be friends. Cynically I think she's not going to reach out and I spent an hour each way driving, took a day off of work for what I wanted to be a great date - I did all of that for nothing.

Of the 3 actual dates I've gone on after many years of rejection and indifference - the first didn't know how to tell me she wasn't interested and ghosted me for weeks, the second said sweet things about me but said she wasn't ready and was still healing from a previous relationship and said I need to be with someone who can do 50-50 in the relationship, and now this, where I felt someone coming onto me and tried to match it, and realizing at the end that I walked away in a toxic cloud of mental fog.

I hate dating. So much. And I hate the way my brain and my emotions work. So much.

Post 514: I’m extremely overwhelmed and need help managing my stress
Content:
I (31F) am extremely stressed and overwhelmed with work. The workload has drastically increased within the last 6months and I’m having a hard time keeping up with is causing a lot of stress and instability. I can’t sleep and don’t have energy for hardly anything outside of work. 

I’ve always had very demanding jobs but this is definitely one of the toughest times I’ve been in. On top of that, my personal life isn’t that swell either. 

I thought I’ve always managed my stress well because I’ve always lived a difficult life but I’m realizing that I’m not handling it well at all. I’m forming bad habits and it’s only effecting my overall productively at work. 

Does anyone have any tips to the best way to handle high stress and feeling overwhelmed with too many tasks at hand?

Any natural tips for sleep aids would be really helpful as well!

I appreciate any and all support!

Post 515: Decrease stress by ADDING a hormetic stressor into your life.
Content:
One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors.  Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor.  It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme.   

We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them.  It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL.  We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort, body relaxation, self talk, etc.  These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally.    

In fact, the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.  If you do that, these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones.

One side note - the app is geared generally to men.

Post 516: Experiencing a physical stress symptom but don't feel stressed
Content:
So I know I'm experiencing stress, because I'm getting a sensation in the back of my head (not quite a headache but a bit of discomfort), which has always been associated with stressful/anxious situations. It started occuring right after I started uni again, so that's probably the cause. The thing is though, I don't feel anxious or anything though, I just have this one symptom.. is this just as bad as being full-on stressed? Like will it age me the same amount that full-on stress will?

Post 518: Dealing with the Critics in Your Life
Content:
Whatever you’re trying to achieve - save the world, write a novel, devote yourself to a particular cause – there are likely to be those who will be critical. Some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour. Criticism is unavoidable. Your choice is in how to respond to it. 

### Consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life:

**Clarify your purpose.** As humans, we are compelled to make meaning. Making meaning for ourselves – and value for others – is fundamental to a life well lived. When you’re doing something very important to you, you care far less about the criticisms of others. If they can easily throw you off your path, you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you. Are you living your purpose consistent with you values?

**Understand the critic’s motivation.** Are they projecting themselves in to the situation – their aspirations, their skill set, their propensity for risk, their values? Are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential down-sides? Are they trying to maintain the status quo – for you, them or both? Are they masking their own lack of action? 

**Recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal.** We have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones. We are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement: people working against us over people supporting us. Most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it.

**Realize that you’re going to be criticized no matter what you do.** Whether you become a billionaire, movie star, teacher, doctor, or sit on the couch all day, there is someone that will tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing. So, live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics don’t want.

**Respond calmly.** Rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response, respond kindly with a considered response. Acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making. 

**Use your critics as motivation.** While some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world, others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation. Remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines, you are on the pitch and playing the game.

**Decide if they have something useful to say.** Some criticism may carry valid points – explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be – the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue. If the criticism isn’t useful, move on. You have more important things to do.

**Take criticism as a compliment.** Most people will leave you alone if you’re struggling or aren’t doing anything noteworthy. You only become a significant target of negative comments if you’re doing well. If you’re taking a lot of heat, you must be doing something correct!

**Live your life without the need for the approval of others.** Live your own life, by your own values. Use your signature strengths to create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future in your chosen pursuit. 

I hope you took something useful from this piece; I have posted a further series of quick reads on my own little corner of Reddit – would be great to see you there.

Post 519: Chronic stress symptoms
Content:
Over the past few years - like most ppl - I’ve had a rough time with covid lockdown, plus then I was diagnosed with hiatal hernia, then divorce, and now financial pressures of single-handedly running a household.

I was hoping to put this all behind me but last summer new symptoms started to appear:

+ IBS / GERD (hiatal hernia)
+ Cardiac arrythmias (thousands a day)
+ Various skin complaints
+ Alopecia Barbae (beard patches)

I’ve now had 9 months of all these symptoms and I’ve tried individual meds like beta blockers, PPI, tweaking diet, exercise with no luck… the docs say this is all because of going through  a major life disruption and it’s due to underlying stress. The cardio and gerd stuff is so bad I’ve started avoiding stuff but I have CBT planned as a last resort treatment. Concerned the stress is permanently damaging my health.

Anyone deal with anything similar? Go through a major event and suffer chronic stress? Any of these symptoms? Did they resolve after a time?

How do you treat underlying, chronic stress?

Post 522: Yin Yoga is a WONDERFUL Way to Regulate the Nervous System and Manage Stress
Content:
 I am a MA level clinical mental health counselor and was recently certified as a Yin Yoga Therapy Instructor. Though I cannot offer individualized/catered sessions, I do provide yin yoga classes on YouTube (@wildheartyogahh) as a free resource to help those who may not be able to afford help in other ways. Many people store emotional energy in the body- specifically in the fascia, since 80% of nerve pathways end in the fascia- and yin targets release of fascia and connective tissue through long (3+ min), passive holds. It is a wonderful, gentle practice, for the mind and body! Hope it can help someone. :)

Post 525: I feel so alone with my problems.
Content:
Rant.

Everyone talks to me about their problems bc I'm "a good listener." But I feel so alone with my own problems.

Then I get angry and frustrated with myself for feeling alone because there are people in my life. I don't lean on them because I'm afraid they can't handle it or that leaning on them will inevitably make my life harder.

I live with my fiance, but he's had health struggles this year, as well as difficulties at work, so he has leaned on me daily, breaking down and panicking before work, calling me for 30-90 minutes a few times a week while I'm at work, breaking down when he gets home from work...after about 20 minutes each time I get overwhelmed and frustrated, but I signal anger. Then he says he feels like he has no support, so I feel like my efforts are wasted.

I have my own problems. But I shove them down and go to work, clean the house, make dinner, basically do the things that need to be done every day. I shoulder the mental load in our household.

My blood pressure has spiked the past few months. I've had a rash on my face for 2 months. I see doctors weekly for migraines and chronic back pain. My parents don't call me, my 2 closest friends both underwent cancer treatments this year, and my fiance is overwhelmed. I work from home, so my fiance is the only person I see each day. 

I feel so alone with my own problems.

Rant over. Back to work.

Post 527: I got extremely stressed in workplace and home.
Content:
To speak I live in South East Asia, where work is long hours and pay is only enough to try to survive a month.

I have been managing my stress with family issues too so everything is a bit of a mishmash as I am angrily typing this down. And autism doesn't help with my stress management either.

I had been working in a shitty workplace. The pay ain't bad but to deal with my boss terrible management and temperament which makes his employee turnover rate is so high .People would stay around for a week up to 3-4 months, with the group chat kept having people leave and join. As of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which I seen since the first day I joined and worked here up until now. I heard that this business has been running for 4-5 years now but from what I seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do as they have tutoring, selling board games/blind boxes and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial tasks at every employee with focus on trying to get more employees to join. I worked around 11-12 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.

Then a few days ago when I got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. At first I didn't think about it much. Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. I got so stressed and tired enough that I didn't get enough sleep after I finally got to excuse myself.

And comes up to today as I had enough with today as I tend after their store and I was a little loopy, I looked like I was sleeping when I'm actually trying to stay awake. The owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minutes and he's going to cut my pay. Then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back, so angry and annoyed that I slapped the store's security camera, HARD. Luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. So I just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke, saying that it worked fine after I reassembled it. I was a little panicked but a little less stressful from that.

Sorry it's more of a rant post, but I do need help managing my own stress and it just came up almost everyday. How do I do it? I felt like I could explode at any point right now.

Post 528: Stress of having a family and trying to keep up with life
Content:
Is it normal to not be able to keep the house clean and catch up on basic household chores. My wife and I work opposite schedules so that we don't have to rely on day care or a babysitter. We have a 16 month old daughter, 2 cats and a dog. I try my best to keep the house tidy but little detail stuff like dusting, vacuuming and mopping seem almost impossible to do and after a day it looks like nothing even got done. Outside chores is a race while she naps during the day and what ever doesn't get done has to wait for a second nap or another day. By no means is my house filthy but there are a lot of projects I can't seem to start and trying to just maintain it is a project in itself. Before the kid I was able to do a lot more but between her and trying to get basic stuff done while working is very draining. Normally I'd wait till the evening to do something after she goes to bed but lately I just wanna play on my phone or watch a movie. I love my family with all my heart and would not change a thing, I'm just stressed because I think of everything that needs to get done and it causes me to procrastinate even more. As a new parent I just need to hear whether or not this is normal. I've been told that one day I'll miss all the hustle and bustle and noise.

Average at math, good at science, biology is favourite.

I've got friends, I've got supportive family, I've never been bullied. But the moment I think of school my anxiety and stress touches sky and I feel like I am not capable of anything. I feel like the social life or the social media "swag" is what makes me feel down, feeling like I'm no match for... Someone. Yes I'm stupid af.

I stress way too much about school-"going to school", "am I looking good ENOUGH"
I compare myself to i don't know what, the cool kids? nah I'm pretty friendly with them

The backbenchers and class clowns? Nope, they're all chill with me and always talk with me.

The big question here is what exactly I stress about and why.

Post 532: I am falling apart.
Content:
I've truly never felt this overwhelmed before. I 19 (F) just started a nursing program and work almost full time. I just moved a few months ago into my first apartment and on top of that got a new car. I ended up leasing because it was my best option but, it is a lot to take on and I had to because my old car was 25 years old and falling apart. I have been sleeping 5 hours a night on average, struggling to work enough to pay my bills, and studying every waking moment of every day every chance that I get. I have a job that is stressful and my manager doesn't respect or appreciate the 4 employees he has and is about to lose them. Does not get that I cannot work 60 hours a week anymore and I cannot teleport from class to work (30 minute away) immediately as class is over. 

It is week 3 and I have lost 15 pounds. Most of the time I don't know where i'm at or what i'm doing. My hair is falling out, i'm nauseous, have no appetite, not sleeping, confused. I generally feel either nothing at all or I am crying and I feel like I and my life is falling apart. Will this get better?

Post 536: My life is about to change
Content:
5 days from today, my life is about to change. While this may or will be a good move for me, I am majorly stressed out due to this change.  Some background, over a year ago, the company that I currently work for, announced that they will be laying off staff at my location and moving operations back to a HUGE city that I personally didn’t want to move back to, so I chose to take my 21 years of service severance package and will be moving further west to the coast. This past year has had issues nonetheless, due to the company stalling our end of work date consistently, which was due to supply chain issues from the Pandemic, which the company didn’t foresee when they announced the layoff and/or work transfer notice. This “stall” has caused a lot of stress on myself and my co-workers with not knowing when we’d all be getting the axe. The company had us all dangling from one meeting to another, when finally, at the end of last May, they announced that our end of work date will be at the end of this August. During this year long “wait” with not knowing when our actual end date would be, the lady whom I rented my basement room from, took it upon herself and just “guessed” that my end of work date would be sometime last May, and basically evicted me out of the basement, however she offered me to stay in another room in the house. She did this so she could get more money from a family of three who moved into the basement last May from the UK. This was an annoyance, however I do get on very well with the family, who are really cool people. I did a massive purge and downsized a lot of my belongings, which what is left,  fits snuggley into my vehicle. I can’t afford to hire a moving truck or get a hitch put on my car and pay for a uhaul trailer…so minimizing was the way to go. With finally knowing my actual end date, I could now start prepping for my move further west to the coast. I applied for school, got in and start in September. My finances are “f’k’d” to say the least, I have had to sink ALOT of money into getting my vehicle road trip ready, and due to this, has left me very short on cash with funding this road trip/move. I needed to get a “temp” place which allows dogs, where the college is,  and seeing how I don’t know a soul in and around that area, I opted to book an air bnb for the moth of September and 1st week of October. This air bnb is pretty pricey. However, I felt I have no choice but to go there and start looking for a dog friendly place when I get there. I applied for another credit card but was denied due to a “fraud alert” on my credit report from 4 years ago when I got my vehicle broken into and my purse was stolen. I went and got and paid for the police record, supplied my passport and driver’s license as photo I.d, and got copies of them all and gave it to the bank where I applied for the credit cards over a week ago. The bank lady sent these copies to the department that issues credit cards, but they didn’t read her “notes” and see the attached files.  😑 the Airbnb payment is due this Thursday, and I was starting to panic. I asked a family member to help me out to no shagrin. 😑 luckily, a very good friend of mine has loaned me the money, knowing I will be getting a HUGE severance payout in mid September. thank god. *whew!* still waiting on my own bank to transfer this Airbnb money to my large credit card, so I can pay the Airbnb. I am hoping that happens today or tomorrow. I got a finally fix done on my vehicle yesterday, and while driving I noticed a strange noise, so I will have to go back there to have it looked at. Seeing how this is my last week of work, my time is stretched. Ugh. Anyhow, thanks to all who have read, thanks for comments if you leave one. On wards to the west/wet coast!

Work felt different, nice for normality.

Instead of stress, today I was bored in parts, I stopped putting a guy on a pedestal as much, I could focus on the present, 

I even joined in on the guy chat with 3 of them, I know they hadnt been doing guy chat with me cos I used to mainly hangout with guys an they'd just been talking about jobs when I was around, they talked about weed, wanking & another girls underwear, they sex talk sometimes anyway but its usually along the lines of joking about my best mate

Id also been avoiding chilling with them when theres more than 2 there but it flowed good with 3, I also avoided using peoples names an said the same NPC "alright" thing, be good to get back into normal convos 

I hope life can just be less stressful for a while an I hope I can get to be a less recluse version of myself an talk regularly. Just relax more.

Post 538: feeling heartbeat in bed
Content:
Hey, usually when I go to bed to sleep and I'm not extremely sleepy to fall asleep right after I almost always sense/feel my heart beating on my neck/throat/ears it's not like it's beating faster than usual or beating harder but I still feel/sense the vibration/pulse of it, when I get jumpy/startled/scared I feel/sense a sudden strong heartbeat right after the event and it's like I feel the sudden increase of cortisol/adrenaline being released inside my body.. ( I sort of feel my sweat production increasing ) even though propranolol improved that which wasn't the case with bisoprolol that was almost totally useless...( wasn't totally useless because it controlled heart rate and blood pressure to acceptable levels as well but still the physical symptoms when I got scared still remained ) the thing here is that I'm always without energy, my brain processes very little information from my senses from the moment I wake up and struggles to keep up with that small amount of information to not say that physically I can feel that I don't have much energy and in terms of stamina I get tired pretty quickly mentally and physically which only gets "treated" when I take a stimulant that is working at 100%. Ah and propranolol is controlling my blood pressure and heart rate to acceptable levels even when I take a stimulant. It makes me confused about my CNS if it is overactive or underactive.....

Post 539: Videogame burnout
Content:
Part of me feels like this is a silly thing to be stressed about but the effect it has on me is very real and makes me feel terrible.

I've been a gamer for 30 years. When I was a kid we had much less to choose from so playing the same videogame over and over wasn't a problem... these days we have tens of thousands to choose from and I own well over 1000 of them. This is my only major hobby, by the way, which is a problem in and of itself. I used to wake up and immediately starting playing something to keep away the feeling of dread in my life because I suffer from depression and anxiety. Games have been my only escape from that nightmare for many years. 

I'm finding now that I can't seem to find interest in them anymore. I have hundreds of games I've not even completed and I want to finish them but the motivation just isn't there. I will seriously stress myself out flipping through all of what I own trying to find one that catches my attention and nothing ever sticks out. I never had this issue 5 years ago but now I'll juat gwt frustrated, panic, and sit at home on my day off doing nothing because my one hobby seems useless to me now. I dont even know how to engage in other activities because I've been on the same pattern for so long. I really juat want to be able to focus and enjoy gaming again. 

This all sounds seriously dumb when I wrote it down, I almost don't want to post this because it feels that stupid but it genuinely makes me miserable. All I do is work and sit at home being bored and boredom is literally killing me. Without the motivation to engage in activities I become consumed by stress and depression. What can I do to find the motivation again? I'm going to go in circles until I die.

I'm a twenty-one year old student that is currently drowning in the stress that is coming from my college course and my new part-time job. 

My job is causing me an unreal amount of anxiety, to the point where I have to hide in the basement sometimes so I can calm down. I work for a second hand shop for games, DVDs, consoles, and devices like phones and laptops, I started working here about a month ago and from my first day I realised that I was really going to struggle here. 

It's a team of about 25 people and nearly all of them are moody pricks that haven't even introduced themselves to me yet! When I ask them a question they give me a look as if I've just murdered their pets. I try to be nice, and I try to keep a positive outlook, but these people are majorly draining my energy and fuelling my anxiety. The customers are even worse! I've been called homophobic slurs, had games and DVDs tossed at my head and have had my life threatened by these people. 

I haven't been trained properly either. I got thrown on the tills with about two minutes explanation of how they work! My till has been down in cash about four times, due to my crappy training and yet somehow this is my fault - maybe it is, but I'm putting this down to crappy training. 

I can't afford to leave this job, I seriously can't. But I also can't stand being there any more. The job market in Scotland is awful at the moment and virtually no companies hiring right now. 

Please, give me some advice before I start screaming every time I think about my work.

Post 542: I feel constantly stressed after going through 5 months of severe stress
Content:
I feel incredibly bad. I get tension headaches everyday, insomnia, and I am low on motivation and empathy and still feel this way even after the good sleep I got tonight. I went through severe chronic stress and anxiety and I self harmed myself and went against all my values, I imagine it's damaged my mental health/brain a lot. :( 

I even have irritable thoughts of my friends when I loved them and always thought the best. I feel sick and ashamed of myself. I don't know if it will get better. Self compassion and compassion for others would help but I regret everything so much and don't think clearly or have the calm and loving emotions and passion I used to.

Post 543: Is this stress?
Content:
Get these weird symptoms in the morning when I wake up until mid day ish. Regardless of how much sleep I’ve had.

-Tension all over face (mostly in head, like a small tension headache, above eye, and in jaw)

-Keep tensing jaw and grinding teeth together

-Losing focus 

Any help would be appreciated.

Post 544: Why am I so stupid? why isn't this working out for me?
Content:
I feel so shitty and stupid. I have to start studying history but it usually takes me way too long to finish a single chapter. Hours. And that's cause I get easily distracted by my thoughts or other outside factors anywhere I am. It happens anywhere and I don't know how to fix it. I can't concentrate, I read a sentence out loud but think I don't know it well of won't remember it well enough so I keep repeating it again and again and again and again and it takes way too long. Other study so fast and easily. Why am I so stupid? Why can't I concentrate??? Why the hell am I like that, why is everyone doing so much better than me??! I used to do so much well at the start why am I taking a turn for the worse??. In 2 months I'll be writing a huge national exam and I can't keep going like this

Post 545: Emerging for a nervous break down. There is hope.
Content:
The last two years have been incredibly stressful for me. I’m a frontline healthcare worker who was dealing with the horrors of the pandemic on a daily basis. I took it all in stride and never saw what was coming my way. 

Around mid Jan (about 10 weeks ago) I started getting waves of exhaustion at work out of no where. I’m talking the type of exhaustion where I was basically paralyzed and had to lay down. One time I laid down on the floor at work because I had no other choice. 

The next week, I started having random chest pains on top of the exhaustion. At one point I thought I was having a heart attack and almost when to the hospital. I went to the doctors thinking I was having cardiac issues but everything checked out. I felt better…for a day or two…

Week 3 is when the real nightmare started. I started having intense anxiety (on top of the exhaustion). Multiple panic attacks a week. I couldn’t do anything without getting short of breath and my heart beating out of my chest. I was a complete mess at work and felt like I was going to collapse and die at any moment. Sometimes I was so physically stressed out I would go to the bathroom and lay on the bathroom floor. It was nuts. 

I called my doctor back and told him what was going on. I was reluctant to start meds but he talked me in to it. Said it doesn’t need to be forever and I can’t go on suffering like this. So I started a low dose SSRI. 

I also started therapy, took a week off from work and am doing much more self care. Like eating healthy and journaling. 

After about 6 weeks of hell, I’m feeling much better. I still have some anxiety here and there but for the most part, have returned to my baseline. I was convinced I’d never be the same again no matter what and I feel like it’s a miracle that I’m even functional now. 

Therapy has also been a huge help even though I was skeptical. It helped me understand that even though I felt blindsided by all of this, it really was building under the surface for a long time. 

Just wanted to say there is hope and don’t give up. I never thought that would happen to me and when it did, it was shocking. But things can get better!

Post 546: Stressed out in the morning.
Content:
Hi guys,

I have been very stressed all my life in the morning but it goes to a point now I sometimes need to take a small benzo to cut out this unbearable stress that prevent me from having a normal life.

I already did cortisol test and I’m in the range but near the top.

I wanted to know what could cause this body stress while doing normal things like walking. It’s like my body react as this activity is a 100 meter sprint when I have this high stress levels.

Thanks for your helps

Post 547: Stress from just existing??
Content:
I don’t feel like theres anything in particular that is causing my stress. Its just having to be alive. I hate waking up in the morning. 
I swear its causing me health problems at this point. Im out of high school and I’ve never had trouble with school but its still happening. I think i live a fairly stress free life but im just stressed from being alive??
Ive tried so many coping mechanisms and none of them seem to work unless im completely distracted and mindless but the second that stops it comes back.
Its gotten to the point where i wake up shaking from stress. Ive tried medications as well and  one of them have worked. I always seem to get the side affects but never what im taking it for. Im tired of this shit.

Post 548: I'm over-reacting all the time
Content:
Like thousands of people in the last two years, I've had a lot of stress. Lost my father, a job, and a dog. Had a heavy load of family dysfunction. Moved cities and found the isolation of the pandemic really tough. Now I find I am in high stress mode all the time. I over-react. Small things irritate me. I feel exhausted. I took a four-day break a couple of weeks ago and it really helped, and I felt my more reasonable and patient self returning. But now the impatient, over-reactive mindset is back and dominating my life. My job is busy and demanding, but I've always managed in the past. Not sure if I am stressed or depressed. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks.

Post 549: [Academic] Curious about how resilient you are? So am I!
Content:
Hi everyone! 

I am a graduate student researcher who studies psychological resilience. I am currently conducting a survey to better understand resilience after experiencing stress and/or trauma. If you are interested in helping with that research, I would greatly appreciate you taking my survey! Additionally, you will be given a resiliency score at the end of the survey, so feel free to take it if you are just curious about how resilient you might be!

During this survey, you will be presented with questions related to resiliency, stress, and trauma. All adults 18+ are eligible to take the survey! Importantly, this survey is anonymous and does not collect identifiable information—so your responses are confidential and not linked to you. 

Totally no pressure. I just thought I would share it here since stress and coping are of special interest to this sub and therefore this research might be of interest to some!

Post 550: How do I cope with my stressful job? I very often feel overwhelmed and close to tears on the job. I get behind on tasks because my job is so busy. I’m scared my bosses will think I’m useless and dumb because I can’t keep track of everything at once and be perfect at everything.
Content:
I can do with some advise, help and insight. I took on another job in the company I’ve worked in for years. This should only be temporary as I’m covering someone who is too sick to do this job and it might be extended after 6 months if this person isn’t well by then. I’m finding it difficult because i am unable to finish a task I’ve started because if another job turns up I have to see to this new job straight away. There’s no getting around that one. On hectic days this can happen multiple times throughout the day and I get behind on my paperwork. I try to get back on track and you guessed it something else’s turns up that I must see to straight away which put me even more behind. On some tasks I’m expected to do testing which is time consuming and whilst I’m doing this sometimes I’m thinking about other tasks I have to do then I start making mistakes which put me further behind because I feel unable to take my time and concentrate because I feel I must not forget to do my other tasks.

Also sometimes other jobs turn up at the same time and I cannot physically be in two places at once. I find this stressful because I’m expected to get the relevant information to do my paperwork and to do it perfectly on these two things that turn up in different places at the same time.

Sometimes I need help lifting heavy items. I’m female and I work on my own. Sometimes the men will help. Other times they won’t because they’re too busy. I don’t push them because I don’t want to be an arsehole but my husband thinks I should be more forceful with them but I struggle with confrontation and I feel intimidated by it. Then I think I’m not suitable for the job because I’m not scary enough to make others bend to my will.

Even though I’m part of a team I work mostly on my own because that’s the nature of my job so I’m unable to have someone help me when I’m snowed under by tasks. Lots of people keep leaving and I’m now finding my managers are putting more tasks on me to do which isn’t helping my stress levels. I feel angry at the people who run this company because they advertised for more workers to join the team. They then offer the jobs to people who are skilled in our workplace but they won’t release them because they’re needed in the other departments because they can’t find anyone else to replace them. Someone else in our department will be retiring soon and I fear more work will be put onto me.

Too make matters worse there is only one other person who knows the basics of my job so when I take holiday leave, I’ll be expected to catch up with the work they didn’t do or done wrong when I get back as well as work coming in that day.

Some days I feel sad and rubbish about myself because everyone else seems more cleverer and calmer than me. I very often experience brain fog at work and forget things and feel overwhelmed. I wish I didn’t have to do this job. I asked for my old job back and they wheedled around me by giving me tips on how to cope when really I’d rather have my other job back.

Sometimes I wonder if I have anxiety and mild depression. I sometimes which I would die to escape having to do shit jobs for the rest of my life in order to survive. I wake up frequently in the night worrying about this job and I tell my brain to shut up and it won’t  shut up. On the weekends I feel de-motivated and I don’t feel like doing much and not much can distract my thoughts away from work. 

Should I stick it out until the summer or leave? I have looked at other jobs but I can’t find anything yet that would suit my capabilities. I feel stuck. Any good advice would be highly appreciated right now.

Post 551: Avoiding stress while working
Content:
Is it ever acceptable to to resign yourself to underemployment to save your life? Stress will probably kill me. Seeing a cardiologist now and my job is zero stress. I’m possibly management material but think that would be stressful.  My field, that I’m technically not really even in, law, is stressful .

Post 552: Stress and worry
Content:
Not sure if anyone can relate but for me although stress is always inherently unpleasant I find myself having this really deep-seated aversion to it because it makes me worried about my health, like very intense and regular bouts of stress could cause a heart attack, aneurysm or other health problems like diabetes, dementia, etc.

It’s like the feeling of agitation from stress is a deterrent but the concern about the effects of stress is an even bigger deterrent.

Post 553: Do you give yourself enough of time to rest/sleep to restore from stress?
Content:
When I was restoring from a burn out, at first I was trying to sleep normal hours. But at a certain point I just slept whenever my body told me to sleep. 

In the beginning I would sleep 2 times 2 or 3 hours during the day, I just could fall asleep again at night. After some time I only made a 2 hours nap after lunch. And now I'm back to normal sleep hours (about 10pm to 6am).

I know people who keep on clinging to the norms of sleeping hours, while the body needs the time to fix itself. If stress would criple us like a flu we would give into the need for rest.

Post 554: What’s wrong with me? Is this normal or am I overstressed?
Content:
Hi everyone. I don’t know what’s going on with me lately but I feel annoyed easily and want to cry a lot. Housework feels like a constant nag that has to be done and is never finished and even though my partner helps me it still feels never ending and I resent that. I work full time doing lates one week and earlies the other week. I feel anxious before the afternoon shift because I’m constantly clock watching and I have to do chores and errands and have little time to unwind and make time for hobbies. The early shift I don’t sleep well and after 8 hours of physical labour I have no motivation to dust and hoover my home because I feel tired and bored by the thought. Also there’s usually other chores which have to be done. The weekends are also full of chores and food shopping which has to be done. And on top of cleaning, cooking, laundry, grocery shopping, errands there’s Christmas to deal with and the thought of making time for that instead of slowing down and taking time for me is making me feel sad and resentful. I just want to please myself and live a calm and contented life but the everyday tasks are too much and have to be done. Am I lazy? Am I depressed? Or is this just good old life and I have to suck it up? Plus it doesn’t help that I work for a bad company who doesn’t look after it’s workers so maybe that’s not helping my mental state? I wish I could spend hours on hobbies and relax. I made time for baking last weekend whilst doing chores but I ended up hating it because I had to clean up and it was time consuming. I normally enjoy baking but not on this occasion. Please help. Any insight to help me would be appreciated. I just want to be happy again.

I just moved to a new city, started a new job, and began college (admittedly for the second time) I'm a bit (a lot) stressed right now. I took a mini cry then work called so I had to stop crying to answer the phone.  There's so much pressure on me and my partner is no longer responding because their cousin is visiting. So I have the weight of the world on me and no support at all. Could really just use some comfort and positivity.

Been under a ton of stress. My work had some layoffs found out my wife had an affair and was almost deployed to a dangerous location outside the wire. I'm no longer getting deployed but all the stress from my marriage and possible looming layoff makes it hard to be productive at work. Being unproductive makes me more stressed. I work from home which makes me feel extremely isolated. Some days the pressure feels so great I think about walking out into the woods alone and killing myself just so I won't have to deal with everything. Anyone else feel the same? Any advice?

Had a big deadline this week and I over ate and feel like crap. Please help!

Hi all!

I'm working on a startup that is developing a device that aims to help people breathe better and relieve stress and anxiety. We don't have anything to sell but we are trying to learn about what would be useful for people (like you) who are interested in stress relief.

If you have a few minutes to spare, it would be fantastically useful for us and much appreciated if you could answer a few Google Form questions about the links between breathing and stress.

Post 562: You can break the chains of past experiences through increasing awareness of your underlying beliefs/assumptions - allowing arising thoughts to pass through your awareness before acting frees your perception and lets you take a new path
Content:
Assumptions can reduce our capacity to cope with reality and lead us to suffering - when we assume we can distort our perception of others and have a negative effect on relationships and ourselves. 

The first step is accepting that we don’t perceive reality, we instead view the world through a lens of our beliefs. Some of these we’re aware of (like our political or religious beliefs), some of them we’re less aware of, like how we view ourselves and other people. Its easy to demonstrate this: if you think of a time where you were in an argument with someone and were exasperated because you couldn’t understand why they didn’t see things your way, it was at least partly because they are viewing the same situation and the same information through a different lens of beliefs, experience, culture, politics etc. Accepting that you and everyone else has this lens and letting go of the idea of objective observation is key.

The next step is to approach the world with beginners mind - where we look at the world with a lack of preconceptions like a child. We can look at life the same way, even things we’re very familiar with - there’s a phrase “know it like the back of your hand” but you can look at the back of your hand and see it for the first time. Looking at your hand you can see the skin, the nails, the bones and joints under the skin, the ligaments. You start to question how well you actually know the back of your hand, I’m not sure I could pick it out from a lineup of hands.

We also need to be aware of our thoughts as they arise, particularly judgemental thoughts. We don’t need to punish ourselves or berate ourselves but simply notice when a judgement arises - that might be |"I don’t like what he’s saying" "this tea’s a bit hot", or "I shouldn’t be feeling this way." We can allow the judgement to pass through our awareness without latching on to it, without doing anything about it. In letting it pass through then we can reduce our own suffering and we can get back to experiencing the present moment.

However if we choose to do so, we can meditate on judgements, beliefs or perceptions and understand the roots. We can take one, for example judging yourself unkindly for making an error at work, make the connection with experiences in our past where beliefs are formed, with relationships with other people, with the culture within our own workplace. By make those connections we can gain insight and start to liberate ourselves from suffering.

Content:
the rest of us. Those who have a heart, and actually care for others. Those who are willing to give people the benefit of the doubt. 

Some of us actually care about you. (Yes, You stranger reading this) Those of us who understand struggle realize that it doesn’t have to be just on your shoulders. As long as you and I respect each other, I have no reason to hate you, dislike you, want the worst for you, take advantage of you. 

I’d rather be your good friend, explore the wonders of the world with a smile with you. Drink a beer with you. Get hammered and have the craziest night with you. Ride with you, swim with you. Cry with you, have a wonderful night with you. 

Why, are there so many women and men out there who want to take advantage of others. 

Treat each other better, BE BETTER, and LIFE will be EASIER, and more SATISFYING.

Post 564: Feeling stuck
Content:
Feeling I’m stuck in both my work and personal life. 

I have a well paid but stressful job. In the first a few years, I voluntarily worked hard for a faster promotion and a better pay. After some successful projects, however, I don’t see a very clear goal. I’d always wanted to move to a management role, but there is no opening. So, I need to continue my current role that has gradually become repetitive for me. Without a clear motivation, the high work load easily turns me into a burnout mode.

My relationship with my partner is complicated as well. After spending many years together and going through some very tough periods, the relationship is more or less stable but I can clearly feel the anxiety to be with my partner sometimes, as the goal is just to go through the day without irritating each other. I can’t say how much love and communications we have between each other. 

A sleepless night. Just trying to vent out …

Post 566: I want to cry. I feel like the dumbest person in the world.
Content:
I’m 25 and currently taking a college precalculus course at community college so that I can have a better future. I grew up poor and getting a good education is a way for me to break free from poverty. I’ve been acing all my classes up until this class which I currently have an 89% in but I have a feeling it might drop significantly due to the fact that I don’t understand the 2 chapters that we were taught. I have a 2 chapter exam and a finals back to back in 12 days since this class is a summer math course and is only 4 weeks. 

We are currently learning matrices and I just don’t get it no matter how hard I try. We were supposed to be taught how to do this since middle school and high school algebra but of course I went to a pretty bad school and was never taught how to do basic row echelon forms. I feel so left behind compared to the rest of my class. Everyday I study for more than 5 hours and I just cannot pick things up. I go to tutoring sessions, ask professors and students for help and I just can’t understand this chapter. I’ve tried YouTube videos and even performing problems on my own, but it just causes this overwhelming feeling in my brain which I cannot really describe. 

I wake up at 5am to prepare for this class on top of going to work. My parents are very stressed and tired and I just want to excel in school, make them proud, and take care of them in the future. Right now, I am so scared my GPA will drop since I want to transfer into a good school. I wish I did better in high school so I don’t have to deal with going to school as an adult.

Post 568: My stress free morning routine.
Content:
 

Here's the morning routine I've been following lately, it helps be stress less throughout the day and helps me focus.

&#x200B;

1. First things first I make sure I'm awake by 7, this gives be plenty of time to finish my routine and get ready for work. I go to bed anytime from 10pm -12pm, so that gives me 7-9 hours so sleep which I feel is plenty.
2. When I'm awake I make sure I don't spend too much time on the bed. I observe my surroundings, sit-up, stretch lightly and get off the bed.
3. Hydrating the body is very important, I make sure to have a huge glass of water first thing in the morning. It helps all the organs wake up and gets them functioning.
4. I then do my quick 5-minute meditation routine to help me focus and get ready for the day ahead.
5. I try to squeeze in small exercise sessions in the morning, if that is not possible I make sure I walk or cycle to work.

The rest of my morning routine is normal, I make sure to take a cold shower followed up by a health breakfast. After which I male sure to note down the most important tasks I want to complete on the specific day.

Give me your suggestion on the routine and would I add anything to my existing routine?

I was a very unhappy 35yo. Not satisfied with my work and under too much work pressure and couldn't spend time with my family. It was like nothing in this world gave me joy. Now that you guys know how I was a few years back, here are the changes mindfulness made in my life.

1. It made me appreciate the small things and gave me a newfound appreciation for life.
2. It helped me alleviate the stress I was under and generally improved my mood drastically.
3. I was much more motivated to tackle things head-on and had more enthusiasm for life in general.
4. And more importantly, I enjoyed every second I spent with my family.

Post 571: I get physically sick/stressed when looking at student loan debt.
Content:
I am currently in graduate school but not full time so my loans are about to be in repayment in about 2 months. 18 year old me got screwed over by discover. Interest rate of close to 14%. Over the 6 years since I started the loans there I owe close to 120k. I cannot refinance because I make less than 12k a year. I cannot make payments  because that 12k doesn't even cover my medical, food, and bill expenses. I know because I'm poor they will reduce the payment to 50$ a month but that will do nothing to bring the ammount down. Everytime I log into my account I litterally get nauseous and my stomach clamps up and occasionally I cry. 

I don't know how to handle that stress. It looms over me and is impacting my life terribly. I can't move out which is really messing with me, I am engaged but my fiance is paying and trying to do everything as low cost is stressful (don't want to elope I know that's selfish but I want a wedding), I am putting off health problems which are adding up because the cost is too high, cannot get a service dog because the cost is too high, I really want a child and I also get super sad because realistically I will have to wait about 6-7 more years.

Does anybody else get this feeling from stress like you're not in control of your own body in any way? Like you can't think critically, or sometimes at all. Your motions are like jelly, and even when you get control, you're super uncoordinated or a clumsy. In social situations, you feel more like a passenger for your own body who has no idea what to say or do but still has the capacity to be angry at yourself for not saying anything or doing something. It's like this self-awareness that stops short of allowing me to do anything. I have a lot of stressors in my life, and I can't help but think they've burnt me out so much so that I've become subject to these things. I've been told before to prioritize or to take on less things as a solution, but to me that's synonymous with settling on being capable of less than I thought I'm capable of. How do people function with high stress? How do you groom yourself to do that? I've lived like this for so many years and thought it would just come with experience, but now it just feel harder than its ever been

I feel like everyone at my office hates me. They think i'm "boring". No. I'm just the only one in the office who doesn't have anyone friends, relationships, or fun outside of the office. I don't have a lot of fun and exciting experiences in life so I literally have nothing to talk about. I"m judged negatively for this everyday. I beat me self up for this everyday. Its like i'm being jumped by a bunch of bullies and i'm the worst one. Support doesn't exist. I live with people I don't talk to at all. No love. I'm unattractive to everyone. I feel like people are just mannequins waiting to tell me that I need to do more or I haven't done enough....They want me to go out and experience things they don't want to be a part of. It's like if you don't want to be a part of my life then don't "help" me. You are a person too. I'm looking at you too. I'm trying to talk to you too. I'm trying to build a relationship with you too. Everyone acts like you. Everyone wants to "help" me like you. Everyone wants to push me away like you. None of you are different. That's why I don't talk. No one is different. No one wants to build anything with me. Everyone expects my life to already be built so I can entertain them from a distance. I want love. I want friends. I want a girlfriend. I want to have fun times with people who want to have fun times with me.

Life's not worth living otherwise.

Post 574: How do I keep going with this assignment?
Content:
So I'm writing my final assignment for uni after 4 years. It's due in 2 days and I have 5000 words left to write. I was diagnosed with Covid just over 2 weeks ago which has left me really behind. I'm still suffering with brain fog and anxiety from covid and I am finding this an impossible task. I'm not someone who quits but I genuinely dont know how I will do this. I cant concentrate at all on the paper and I dont know how I can keep going with it. Not sure why I'm writing this. I guess I just need to have a moment to panic and stress.

Post 575: Does anyone have any ways to handle situations not being fair?
Content:
I’ve known for a while one of my biggest triggers, when I’m stressed especially, is fairness. Basically if a situation has an outcome I’m not happy with I end up thinking “well this didn’t happen with this person?!” I know it’s petty and I’ve found I can step back and not react to a situation immediately which has cut out a lot of problems but I cannot seem to get past it. 

I end up having the situation replay over and over in my head and I end up with my anxiety going through the roof. 

Has anyone got anyways to control it?

Post 576: Best Ways to Reduce Stress and Anxiety
Content:
From minor difficulties to significant disasters, anxiety is part of existence. And as you can not always control your circumstances, you are able to control the way you react to them.

When anxiety becomes overwhelming, also it is chronic, it may take a toll on your own well-being. That is why it's important to get effective stress relievers which could calm your brain and your own body.

And what works for you at home may not be a choice when you are at work or at the area (dance around your living area may be useful but dance at the grocery store may not be).

So it is important to get an assortment of pressure relief tools available. Following that, you will have the ability to select a plan that is most suitable for your present conditions.

Short-Term Stress-Relief Plans You Can Do Anywhere

Whether you are planning to be interviewed for a job or you are feeling overwhelmed by your children's behaviour in the playground, it is important to get some anxiety reduction tools which may decrease your anxiety at the moment.

The Finest short-term plans:

Can Be Done anywhere

Take very small exercise to learn

Are liberated

Give immediate relief

Try Guided Imagery

Guided imagery is similar to taking a brief holiday on mind.1﻿ It may entail imaging yourself being on your"happy place"--perhaps picturing yourself sitting on a beach, listening to the waves, smelling the sea, and feeling the hot sand beneath you.

Guided imagery may be carried out with a recording in which you listen to a person help you through a calm scene. Or, as soon as you understand how to do it your self, you are able to practice guided imagery by yourself.

Only close your eyes for a moment and walk through a calm scene. Think about all of the sensory experiences you would participate in and let yourself feel as if you are really there.

Meditation brings short-term pressure relief in addition to lasting stress management advantages. There are several distinct kinds of meditation to attempt --every is unique and attracts its own allure.2﻿

You may develop a mantra which you repeat in your mind while you take slow deep breaths. Or, you could take a couple of minutes to practice mindfulness, which entails being in the present time.

If you are centered on the here-and-now, you will not have the ability to ruminate about something that happened and you can not be concerned about something later on. Meditation and mindfulness require exercise, but it might make a large difference in your overall stress level.

Progressive muscle relaxation entails relaxing all the muscles in our bodies, group by grouping.3﻿ To practice, you can begin with a couple deep breaths.

Afterward, exercise tightening and relaxing every muscle group, beginning with your brow and moving down to your feet.

With exercise, you will learn how to recognize tension and stiffness in your muscles and you will have the ability to relax more easily. Every time you exercise, nevertheless, you need to experience a sense of relaxation sweeping throughout your entire body.

&#x200B;

# Concentrate on Breathing

Simply focusing on your breath or changing how you breathe could make a large difference to your general stress level. Breathing methods may calm your body and your mind in only a couple of moments.4﻿

&#x200B;

The best news isthat nobody around you'll even know you are doing them. So if you are at a stressful interview or you are sitting at a crowded theatre, breathing exercises may be crucial to reducing your anxiety.5﻿

&#x200B;

While There Are Lots of different breathing exercises, such as karate breathing, a Couple of Straightforward ones include:

&#x200B;

Count slowly to three because you inhale. Hold for a minute and then slowly breathe out through your nose because you count to 3 . Imagine that atmosphere spreading throughout your entire body. As you exhale, imagine that you are breathing out pressure and tension.

# Have a Walk

Exercise is an excellent stress reliever that may work in moments. Taking a walk permits you to enjoy a change of scenery, which may get you into a different mindset, and provides the benefits of exercise too.

&#x200B;

So if you simply have to have a stroll round the office to find a rest out of a bothersome undertaking or you opt to go for a long walk at the park after work, walking is a very simple but efficient method to rejuvenate your body and mind.6﻿

&#x200B;

From the solitude of your home, there are lots of stress relief plans which could enable you to unwind fast. So if you have had a difficult day on the job or you are worried about how much you've got to perform, these plans may provide you some instant relief from your own stress.

&#x200B;

Physical contact may do a great deal to alleviate your anxiety.

&#x200B;

Oxytocin is associated with high levels of pleasure and reduced levels of anxiety.

&#x200B;

Oxytocin also causes a decrease in blood pressure.7﻿ it lowers the stress hormone norepinephrine and may make a feeling of relaxation.

&#x200B;

Therefore don't be scared to request a loved one to get a hug if you require it. It is very good for the two of you and it may be among the easiest kinds of anxiety relief accessible.

&#x200B;

Aromatherapy has real advantages for stress relief--it might allow you to feel energized, more relaxed, or even much more existing at the present time.

&#x200B;

Emerging research indicates certain scents can change brain wave action and reduce stress hormones within the body.8﻿

&#x200B;

So whether you like candles, diffusers, or entire body products, look at integrating some aromatherapy in your day.

&#x200B;

# Create Art

Getting in touch with your creative side might have been simple for you during youth, but if you've lost contact with your penchant for art, it is not too late to pick this up again.

&#x200B;

If you are not into painting or drawing, consider coloring in a coloring book. Adult coloring books have grown in popularity and for good reason--bleach could be a fantastic stress reliever.9﻿

&#x200B;

Research consistently indicates that coloring may have a meditative effect. 1 research discovered that stress levels drop in people who were coloring complicated geometric patterns, which makes it an ideal outlet for anxiety reduction.

&#x200B;

Particular habits can promote resilience to pressure, in addition to increase overall wellbeing. By way of instance, people who exercise or meditate frequently are somewhat less worried in the face of a challenging challenge.10﻿

&#x200B;

So it is important to make a lifestyle which can allow you to ward off anxiety and cope with challenges in a healthful way.

&#x200B;

A bad diet may bring increased reactivity toward anxiety. 11﻿ Emotional ingestion and reaching high-fat, high-sugar foods can offer a temporary sense of relief which adds to a long-term stress.

&#x200B;

Processed carbohydrates, such as cookies and potato chips, can lead to a spike in blood glucose. If your blood sugar crashes, you may experience more anxiety and nervousness.

&#x200B;

Consuming a nutritious diet can help you fight anxiety over the long haul. Foods such as eggs, avocado, and walnuts encourage disposition regulation and energy balance.

&#x200B;

Leisure activities can be an excellent way to alleviate stress.12﻿ However, a lot of men and women feel like their lives are too busy for games, hobbies, or even additional pleasure.

&#x200B;

But constructing time for leisure in your program could be crucial to helping you feel your best. When you are feeling better, you are going to perform better, meaning leisure time can make your work time more effective.

&#x200B;

Whether you discover delight in caring for a backyard or you enjoy making quilts, leisure and hobbies are crucial to living your very best life.

&#x200B;

# Create a Favorable Self-Talk Habit

How that you speak to your own issues. Harsh self-criticism, self-doubt, and devastating predictions are not valuable. If you are always thinking things such as,"I do not have enough time for this," and"I can not endure this," you will worry out yourself.

&#x200B;

It is very important to learn how to speak to yourself at a more realistic, more compassionate way. If you call yourself names or doubt your ability to be successful, answer with a kinder internal conversation.

&#x200B;

And a positive and compassionate dialogue can help you handle your emotions and take positive actions.

&#x200B;

# Exercise Yoga

Yoga unites physical movement, meditation, mild exercise, and controlled breathing--most of which offer exceptional stress relief.13﻿

&#x200B;

And as you are very likely to reap instant benefits from one yoga session, then you are very likely to get long-term gains if you integrate it into your own life in a constant manner.

&#x200B;

Yoga provides a number of physical, emotional, and spiritual advantages. To begin, you could take a course, enroll in an internet program, or utilize a program that will assist you start practicing.

&#x200B;

Gratitude makes it possible to recognize all of the things you must be thankful for. Whether you are thankful for a bright day or grateful you came at work , think about all of the great things you need in life.

&#x200B;

Gratitude also reminds one of each the tools you need to deal with anxiety, which is quite empowering.

&#x200B;

Post 577: 3 minute survey on stress and heart problems
Content:
Hello all, a week ago we posted our first research survey on stress and heart conditions in this subreddit. We are very grateful and humbled by the community response. Thank you to everyone who participated, for your willingness to help our early-stage research. 

We have just begun a new survey, more focused on solutions (still in early development) for stress management among those suffering from heart conditions. It has more questions than the previous one, but it should take 3 minutes or less to fill in.

If you feel that stress management is relevant for your heart condition(s), and if you have 3 minutes to spare, we would highly value your participation in our survey: [https://91x0xncg6xj.typeform.com/to/fFTxcy3n](https://91x0xncg6xj.typeform.com/to/fFTxcy3n)

Post 580: Is it normal to feel stressed while doing things that used to relax me?
Content:
Just like everyone else, my life's been pretty stressful the last year. Ive usually dealt with stress and anxiety by doing relaxing things (to me) like looking at memes, reading, and playing the piano (I'm very bad at it, but I like to follow YouTube tutorials)

Recently I've noticed that anytime I've tried to learn a new piece or do something more complex while playing, I've immediately become very anxious, my heart beat speeds up, and I get very uncomfortable. This is all very weird because I've never had these "panic attack" type things (I know it's not a real panic attack, and I'm not trying to diminish a real one, it's just the best "euphemism" I can come up with), and I've never had a problem learning more complex things on the piano.

Is it normal to eventually feel stressed by something that used to do the opposite? Theres no one forcing me to play the piano, no obligations to it, and nothing that should make me feel stressed about it.

Life is incredibly stressful right now. I'm in grade 11 and caught Covid last October. I was horribly ill for 2 months. My bones were aching, constant soreness and I couldn't even breathe. Even if I tried I just couldn't get up. 
-
This left a HUGE impact on my grades. Now Im worried about my acceptance into the University of Toronto :( The admission requirements state that I need high 80s-low 90s in all of my classes...Im in my 70s😣 There's also a huge pressure on me to attend this university too so its just making this situation worse.

Is there anything you found helpful that kept you motivated in school? Did anyone else manage to get into their dream college/uni despite low grades? Anything would help me rn thank you!❤️

Post 582: Focus Tip: Plan for unplanned
Content:
Hey folks, I was a long time overworker and decided to change that to myself. When I succeeded, I started helping others and made it my mission to reduce people's excess of work. I share daily Focus and Productivity tips around the webz and will start posting them here as well.   


Today's Focus Tip, y'all. You work 8 hours a day? Then don't EVER plan 8 hours worth of job. That's bullshit. The world won't stop because you planned something and soon someone will need your help, grab your attention, a wild notification will appear or something will happen differently than you imagined.

&#x200B;

Unplanned things happen. It's a fact. If you don't plan yourself considering it, you are not a victim of other's interruptions, you are an accomplice.

&#x200B;

Suggestion: Plan your day with some extra time meant for interruptions and unplanned stuff. If you work 8 hours in a normal job, plan, for example, 6 hours worth of tasks. If something unplanned happen, you'll be able to deal with it, finish your planned tasks and finish your day having completed everything you needed. If your environment is really chaotic, plan even less time of focused work and leave more time to unplanned stuff.

&#x200B;

There are tons of advantages about it: it will reduce your stress, you won't desire to punch who interrupts you, you'll feel better with yourself for accomplishing good results. Have a great time, folks. Cya tomorrow.

Post 583: I have a lot of things going on at the same time and it’s making me stressed to the point I feel sick.
Content:
I’m hoping that somehow me typing all this out will help me overcome everything and make me feel better. 

I started a new job in the beginning of November. Everything was going good until Thanksgiving. My fiancée and I made the decision we would visit family that day. In hindsight, that was stupid. The day after, my sister started feeling sick and tested positive for COVID, and then her family was getting sick and the ones that got tested were positive. My work told me I had to quarantine, but since I was new, they wouldn’t give me paid leave. That left we with 2 weeks of not getting any money. Thankfully, I had some savings to help scrape by on bills, but I had to go through all of that. Since then, I’ve been struggling and the end of the month bill marathon has been cutting it too close. Had a lot of unexpected expenses. We’ve been living in a 1 bedroom apartment and we are wanting to move into a house because we have no room for anything. Had to store a lot of belongings in our cars. We are also planning a wedding for the end of October. I’m trying to go back to school so I don’t have to work a 3rd shift factory job for the rest of my life. She’s been dealing with PTSD for a few years and has had an uptick in panic attacks the past few weeks. It’s become too much for me to handle. Been dealing with suicidal thoughts. I don’t know what to do.

Post 584: Everyone always tells us to do it, so here is one way of HOW to actually do it.
Content:
The ultimate self-care? Having an amazing relationship with yourself. 

How? 

❤️Decide to have a great relationship with yourself. Decide that it is a JOURNEY not a DESTINATION. 

🧡Show yourself love: practice gratitude for what you ARE, in this instant. Smart, creative, hard working, determined, accepting. 

💛Have respect for yourself: respect how your body is feeling and what it is thinking, it is just trying to keep you alive with the tools it currently has. (Negative self talk used to be an evolutionaly perk-its not your fault.)

💚Basic Needs: drink water, cook one good meal a day, move your body. 

💙Love Language: what is your love language to yourself? Words of affirmation? Gift giving? 

💜Honesty: don't lie to yourself about what you are feeling or thinking. If you think you are dumb, or fat, or worthless, don't fight that, acknowledge it, and look to see the facts. Reach out for help, I have MANY tools to help with these types of thoughts! 

🤎Forgiveness: when you do something 'bad' or 'wrong' acknowledge it, and then fix it. 

🖤Listen: if you are tired, take a break. If you are happy, celebrate! If you are sad, feel your sadness, and then move to a desired emotion. 

Write out one part you want to do today, and put it somewhere you can see it. (I recommend fridge or bathroom mirror)

Sometimes doing this alone can be hard, frustrating, or scary. Especially if we have neglected ourselves for the majority of our life. I am here to help guide you though this in a way that is actually fun and enjoyable and feels good ❤️ I am here.

Post 585: Just because it is a big problem, doesn't mean you have to have a big solution. It actually can be easy 💛

If you look up how to relieve stress on Healthline,

Tip #3 is to light a candle. 

Tip #6 Is to chew gum. 

As someone who has been under moderate to severe stress, this is more than a little insulting. 

Oh, you were sick and missed 2 days of school and now you have to make up 2 exams, write an extra credit paper, and hope your friend took good notes for you? 

Here, eat a mint. 

😂 It makes you laugh it is so rediculous. 

BUT, 

Don't let your brain think that just because it is a big problem, it requires a big solution. 

Peppermint, (study done my MSU 2016) can do SO MANY things!! 

-Increase memory, altetness, and processing speeds. 
-sleep enhancement, better mood, and decrease stress.
-increases digestive processes and increases pain tolerance! 
-It also helps you drive better lol. 

My point? 
It doesn't have to be HARD to solve your problem!! 

Is minty candy going to solve all your problems? 

No.

But it might help, if you let it 💛

Post 588: How do you cope with uncertainty?
Content:
I'm so anxious. This pandemic has made me realize how scared I am of uncertainties. The main reason I'm stressing out rn is because I'm unsure whether I'll be able to finally pursue my plans for work this year. I was supposed to fly to the US for work last year but covid happened. It has been a roller coaster ride since then. One moment I am told that I might no longer have the job offer then after a few months they tell me that they will still hire me which is great but I'm scared I might get some bad news again. This job means a lot to me. With everything that has been happening, I can't help but worry that things might now go as planned again this year. I worry about it every single day. Uuuggh. I should stop thinking too much but I can't get it off my mind. My head hurts

Post 590: why am i so different to everybody else
Content:
I’m ed (18M) studying mathematical physics at nottingham and i can do a lot of shit. I’m (relatively) academically intelligent, have played the piano since i were 6, write&produce my own music [put my first solo project on spotify TODAY], i’m about top 100 for Duathlon sports in UK unis/colleges etc. I have incredible, loving (yet divorced) parents who are amazing and i really appreciate. My step-parents are great and my step-brother is one of my best friends.
On paper, i’m living the dream. Yet i just can’t find any sort of peace with myself, i get overwhelmed/stressed with too much social interaction and i’m always critiquing myself. My mum’s a counsellor and we just don’t get along (mindset-wise) and she claims i have mild Asperger’s syndrome, as a number of my friends/teachers have previously said.
This doesn’t bother me because the result is irrespective of anything in my life, but recently i am finding myself thinking about some deep, dark shit (although a lot of which i know i would never do). I have been in this place before, multiple times, but this definitely feels different.
I’ve had some close calls before, very serious car crash when i was 17 and a trip to hospital of an LSD trip gone majorly wrong. I would love to say i care but it seems as if i’ve just given up on myself recently, i want to be the best person i can but i have NEVER successfully managed a friendship which hasn’t gone wrong (probably because of me) and i’ve never been emotionally involved because i am so fucking insecure of everything to do with emotions. i have never EVER spoken about myself like to this anyone before, let alone to the public, i just don’t understand it.
I appreciate this has been a very tedious message to read but i humbly assure you it was more painful to write, the only reason i did was because i’m currently avoiding my parents at all costs because i physically can’t have a conversation with anyone right now, i’m exhausted. (it’s xmas day!)
recently i’ve noticed the way my brain works is totally different to everyone else and it’s unsettling knowing that none of my friends or family will understand who i am.

edit: i am also developing a very minor drug problem, i’ve been high everyday for the past few weeks because i cave in and give up with trying to sort stuff out whilst sober

i sort of want to say merry christmas but i feel like i’ve just contradicted any sort of ‘christmas spirit’


tl;dr
nothing i ever do will fulfil me because i’m a greedy cunt and i’m struggling to find any qualities in myself despite what people say. also might be autistic and i can’t deal with emotions whatsoever
why am i so different

Post 592: I feel like I've nowhere to turn
Content:
What do you do when you've complained to your friends and family so much about stress over the years that no one even takes you seriously anymore? I'm in a bad place where I e got a lot of seriously important life events to get on with and no energy left to do them. Everyone I'm close to is breathing down my neck about getting stuff done when I can barely get out of bed. If I try to explain what's wrong I'm greeted with rolled eyes or being told to grow up. Suicide has never been an option for me but now with the addition of some serious medical problems that I haven't even sorted out yet I'm in so much mental and physical pain 24/7 that I don't feel like I've got the energy to try anymore. I really just want help but it's impossible to get professional help right now, and everyone I love is sick of hearing about my problems or doesn't have the slightest idea of how to help me. I deleted this post a few times not sure if I should bother but I'm at the end of my rope here. I can't seem to convey how in trouble I am to anyone close to me so I feel like there's no way to improve my situation. On top of that I'm supposed to be moving 800 miles away by December 1st when I haven't even started packing yet and I'm totally broke. I'm essentially completely screwed right now and I havent the slightest idea of how to fix this, like I said I can barely get out of bed. I really don't want to die yet, there's stuff I'd like to accomplish first, but I've no idea where to go from here. It seems like there is no support whatsoever or people think I'm too stubborn to get anywhere with me. Even doing drugs has no effect. I spent a good decade doing drugs to help manage my stress but they have no effect anymore. 

This is just my version of flailing around screaming I need help hoping someone can just throw me a raft or I'm just going to drown. I'm out of money, out of time and out of options. So what the hell does someone even do in this situation?

How do you guys cope with a demanding boss? My new boss sends work-related messages and errands even during weekends or late at night beyond office hours. It's getting really stressful. I was recently hired as a head of the finance department. I've been in this new company for 2 months. Since I'm the newbie, I've been answering the boss even beyond working hours. At 2 months, im already worn out. I don't feel any work-life balance. They expect you to be available 24/7 to attend to work concerns. I've been thinking on quitting but I'm worried it would be hard to find another opportunity. Do you think it's okay for me as a new hire not to answer messages or emails beyond my working hours? :(

Post 597: I've read that we aren't aware of 90% of what is going on around us. (In terms of energy, electromagnetic fields, vibrations, spirits, angels, brainwaves, wavelengths, frequencies and ect.)
Content:


Personally I believe in this especially because I've experienced a lot of events that many would consider "weird, hallucinations, paranormal and spiritual".

For example, I went to bed to my girlfriend who just had fallen asleep a couple of minutes earlier and right after laying down I saw this glowing green orb exiting her body, coming in front of me as if it was looking at me and then reversing outside my bedroom window.
I'm 100% sure it was her Spirit.(light body or whatever you wanna call it.)
One time I was Meditating "Buddha style" with my eyes halfway closed and saw this huge glowing golden orb approach me.

Nowadays while thinking or talking to someone  I get to see these shining small orbs appear out of nowhere and stay there for a while. All varying in different colours. Nowadays I mostly see blue.

All of this has been happening to me since 2013 when I've started Meditating and getting really into spirituality. 

If you are interested I've made this [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/Wl1hPZUFM3g) about which method of Meditation opened my awareness to be able to witness these sightings. Let me know your thoughts on it!

I was part of a like... I'm not good at talking but like... there's some rare niche program that lets you make computer games..

Any time I asked for help in the forums, people always responded with "Yeah, I COULD very easily help you out with your coding problems, I see what you did wrong and I could give you advice... But instead, I'm just going to laugh at you for being such a bad programmer!!"

And then they invited me to a Discord and they were all about "memes" and everytime I chatted there, people would post weird Pepe meme faces etc and make fun of me

Then someone invited me to a smaller Discord saying its not like that there, but it is.

And whenever I posted on Reddit and other places, often times people would say "Is this a troll thread???" so then I try to say "and no this is not a troll thread" but then people respond saying "this must be a troll thread if you say no this is not a troll thread"

its so freaking noisy here and I feel very stressed out and anxious about stuff but I'm too afraid to post about it anywhere

I thought it was safe to post in a community for autistic people since I too have autism, but a moderator banned me, saying the ban reason is that I "am a clear bad example of someone with autism."

I just don't feel comfortable venting anywhere

and haters found my private vent videos and re-uploaded them on to youtube without my permission at all, and my online friend (who says he would've blocked me by now but he's too nice and he always says depressing negative things to me every day multiple times) said people were linking to those videos and making fun of me saying I'm not "mature" for venting in those private venting videos that the haters re-uploaded from my private vent account onto a public YouTube channel without my permission to make fun of me.

I just don't feel comfortable at all and I feel so bad..

Post 600: Subconscious anxiety manifesting physically - need help
Content:
Recently I found myself having a sensation of tightness in my chest and throat (globus sensation). It’s been around for about 2 weeks now (no, it’s not COVID) and it’s super uncomfortable. The only relief I get is sleep.

I don’t have as many anxious thoughts like I used to but I am under a lot of stress with work. There is nothing I actively dislike about my job; it’s just that there’s a lot to do at the moment and it probably won’t let up for another few weeks. I’d happily work through it except I can’t go one minute without feeling like I need to inhale very deeply because of this horrible sensation in my throat and chest. 

I was on 10 mg of citalopram until recently (which helped me out of a really bad patch) and I’ve upped to 20 mg on the advice of my GP. Waiting for it to kick in. 

I have also been taking 100 mg of L-theanine twice a day in the morning and at night. I take 600mg of KSM-66 Ashwaganda at night too. I also have tried diazepam on occasion (I‘m wary of its addictive properties so I don’t take it regularly and am not comfortable with taking more than 4mg in a day) but this sensation is not going away. Beta blockers make me incredibly tired - I’ll happily try it on a weekend but for work days it’s not going to be great.

Does anyone know any way that I can get some relief from this? I don’t exactly know what I’m anxious about so I can’t actually change my thought patterns. The work stress is probably one of the causes but there’s nothing I can do about it at this moment and I just wish that it didn’t manifest itself in this horrible physical way.

Backstory - I definitely have issues with anxiety and have done for pretty much my whole life. Had a really bad period between April and June but through counselling and changing my medication, my thought patterns have definitely got on better. I also changed jobs which has been a massive help.

Post 601: How to work without being stressed?
Content:
Hi! I am a college student (F 20) and premed. I am at a competitive college and doing reasonably well academically. My issue is dealing with stress when it comes to workload. When I have too many tasks to do, too many assignments or studying to get done, I feel very overwhelmed and very stressed and upset and sad. I am just 20 and life is easy for me honestly, so I feel very irritated at myself for stressing out to much. When I stress, its difficult for me to work as well, I just want to lay in bed and vanish from the world for the whole day.

I just want to be one of those chill, happy, carefree people. The kind of people who can just do all their work but without being so overwhelmed and feeling hopeless. Honestly, I am capable and always get things done and keep a good record. So, why do I always feel so hopeless and behind? I just hate feeling stressed. I know in the back of mind i don't need to stress, and if i didn't, i could just do my work.

I am not depressed btw. So, any tips? Thanks a lot

Content:
I have put up with a toxic coworker for 4 years because this is the only job I could do, due to an injury and this being non physical laid back security guard job.

The guy I have worked with has been the most toxic/weird/sociopathic guy who I’ve worked with in my life and others have said the same but I’m stuck working with him for 4 years.
Tomorrow I finally talk to HR about his behaviour towards me, and I’m nervous because all that stress buildup from 4 years is finally pouring out. From age 21-25, I’ve been repressing these feelings.

Im having panic attacks and can’t sleep at all for past 2 weeks. How do I calm myself down and not think too much about losing or getting removed from my current job location?

Post 605: Can’t manage to stay stress-free for long
Content:
I’m so tired. I had a wonderful weekend, fairly low stress. Then I made the mistake of looking at my assignments page since tomorrow is Monday and, alas, a new school week begins. One of my profs just...I don’t think he realizes we students actually have lives?? He’s constantly giving us so many new homework assignments without any warning - and his class portal is never fully outlined, so yeah, no warning at all. So, now I’m coming out of the weekend (that was so peaceful) with a fresh load of stress caused by a new ton of homework. Frankly, I’m upset, stressed, and a tad angry because I feel like I’m drowning under the weight of all of this. I can’t catch a break. Every time I get ahead, something happens that shoves me back again. Every time I knock out two assignments, five more take their place (and I’m not exaggerating - I went into the weekend with two assignments and finished those, and now I have five more that came out of nowhere). Any advice to save me from this overwhelming sense of being lost while I scramble to complete these assignments? I’ll finish them all on time because I HAVE to, but without any proper, healthy stress management, I’ll be in tears the whole time.

After some research online it appears I'm heading for a burnout. I'd like to avoid that. Do you know any good book about that? There doesn't seem to be many of them. I found some that appeared to be good but they were geared toward women, and I'm a man.

Post 607: I'm really stressed from school, but my dad will kill me if I'm not in honors
Content:
 My dad is very invested in my schoolwork, and grades, if I get anything other than an A in my classes he would punish me (not beat me or anything, like take away devises). But I can get really stressed out from all the pressure, and I tend to just stop working all together, or just not get out of bed. And being with my parents in lockdown has made me double stressed, but I'm not allowed to just lie in bed and forget I exist, so I used to goof around on m computer, and ignore my work. I know I can do it but whenever I try I end up crying because I don't know something. And this usually happens with math. Sooo... i haven't done my math in months, because I think I'm stupid and can't do anything. My dad just found out I haven't done math in a while, and said "you're making me really depressed". And now I don't know what to do. because if I get kicked out of honors math my dad will kill me, but if i stay in it I will be miserable. what do I do?

Hey, 

First time poster.  To cut the story short  things don’t seem to be going well right now. I’m a middle aged type 1 diabetic patient currently going through a lot of financial issues right now. My pops who provided for most of us passed away due to covid. And at that point we found out he was deep in debt so his house may not be around for much longer. 

Currently it’s me and my sister 2 at home. Money is running out. I need to buy my diabetic drugs and immunosuppressant and also need to get food . We have about €53 left and it’s not going to do much. I was able to buy quarter of a bag of beans and rice just to hold us for a while. 
The stress really isn’t good for my health and the lacks of supplies is making things worse. Woke up this morning any my blood sugar was 15 mmols. 

I’m in need of series help. If anyone has any advice they can offer I’d be very appreciative. 

I apologize for any English mistakes.

Post 611: Screen Time Negatives
Content:
I feel like these screens are more harmful than we realize. As we’ve turned to them during this global lockdown for a way to connect to people safely, I feel another trend has arisen and that’s the negative effects that these screens have on our interactions.

Demand: People expect you to be available at the drop of a hat, because they know you’re currently glued to your phone. Hyperbole aside, I make sure my phone migrates from room to room with me. For work, for emergencies, it doesn’t stray from my side. That doesn’t mean I owe anyone an immediate answer.

Distance: You can type things you wouldn’t dare say out loud. (Like what I just typed about not owing anyone an immediate response.) Because you can’t see the persons face, you are less in tune with their reaction and therefore less concerned about the effect your words will have.

Curating Interactions: Because it’s not instant, you have time to craft your response. That means the exchange of texts or emails when it resembles a conversation is a highly curated interaction in which each participant can choose how long they take to perfect their response. While this should promote clarity in that you can take your time to gather information and respond, it actually means people have time to manipulate answers. 

Intentional “On Read”: There can be an effect to silence. Sometimes silence speaks. Think about a pregnant pause in natural conversation that lets you know someone is thinking... When we can use the screens between us to ignore someone, to be silent, sometimes that’s louder than outright hostility. 

Concluding my list as I write this at 00:38, I was up having these thoughts and letting them run their course hoping they would serve the same purpose as counting sheep. No luck. The contemplation woke me up and for fear of losing my train of thought, I immediately reached for my phone. Now I’ve extended this late night indefinitely as I labor over this post and begin yet another highly curated interaction between strangers using screens. Who’s with me? 🤓

Can someone help me and help me to get rid of trust issues.

Post 613: How I overcame my pornography addiction & why I started to change my life for the better.
Content:
This is tough for me to talk about but I thought this story will help inspire men. Growing up as a teenager I had a really bad pornography addiction. I used to watch it 7 days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence. It made my dating life and sex life horrible. I knew I was better than that, I could not believe this was taking over my life and how could I  let it get this far. So one day I was like fuck this I need to get my life together. I started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies. I tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes. It was amazing I met some great friends. I started eating healthier. I did everything I could to take my mind off it. I started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer. I EVEN started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography. It was a very tough process but I was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after 6 1/2 months. So the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you. What controls your mind controls your life! Mental toughness!

For the first time, I failed a module this year and it wasn't because the work was too hard. Not even that I was lazy but now I am finding it difficult to see the point because a more important issue has appeared in my life. That being what the fuck am I doing or going to do. I have no plan after college or better yet what I'm going to do before I die. I am stressed about just being alive and how it makes no sense. That's all :/

Post 616: Does anybody else have a friend/or S.O. that is a good friend you've had a long time, but every text conversation usually ends up with you feeling drained, irritated, and in a really bad mood?
Content:
Alright I'll try not to make this super long ... so basically I have been really good friends with someone for like 5 years and is always there for me to turn to when I need his help and will do about anything that I may ask always has my back etc. I really value him and how he always helps me to not worry because he will never let me down...but I feel like every conversation, for lack of a more fitting word..that he is constantly cutting me off even before I get a chance to respond before he starts talking again dominating the whole conversation and bombards me text after text after text not giving me any time to reply to anything and if I do get a message in, it doesn't make much difference on what I'm feeling and trying to get across and it's only after he sends 4-5 texts before mine shows up in the thread before what I said was acknowledged and addressed and then after it's briefly talked about then he again just talks and talks and sends numerous texts in a row and won't fucking shutup until I get to the point of overwhelming anger taking full control over me and then I end up having an anxiety attack that doesn't end for at least 30mnz after I have cussed him out  ,or attempted to and completely cut off wasting one more minute of time and quit the conversation for good feeling drained of everything and out of energy. Sorry this was a little longer than I expected and I hope makes sense because it's been a long really bad day and I'm trying to come across as able to make sense of. 
I would like to know if anyone has gone thru this or anything similar and what did you do that stopped it from happening ever again?

I’ve been with my bf for almost 3 years now and I know he loves me but it’s starting to not be enough, he’s never happy with me, looses his patience with me so easily and I think it’s time for me to go. I live with him and his dad so I’d be the one to leave and I can’t go back to my parents. I have a drug and alcohol problem so I had to move to a different place to start over again and I can’t move back there... I’ll either try to end my life or go off the rails. Home viewings are off until further notice because of the whole pandemic so I can’t even try that option. Another thing that is killing me is that I love his dog so much, the dog isn’t mine but he feels like mine. The dog is attached to me, hangouts with me way more and it’s all the dogs choice too. My heart breaks so much when I think about leaving. I know I can’t stay in a unhappy relationship I just am so unbelievably stuck.

Everything fucking sucks. All school does is make me fucking stressed with mocks, family pushing down every inch of me into the ground. I broke down in my room, and my dad comes in almost straight afterwards and just tells me to remember to give him a fucking report next week when my priority is mocks. They yell at me a couple of times a week for dumb shit such as not answering my phone when I am 1 room away from them. I get top grades for them, working my ass off and they never even care about it even my mom saying I don't care what you get. That shit just stabs me in the heart. Then there's school which is just throwing dagger after dagger, essay after essay, exam after exam, asking you to work afterschool when I want is a break. My friends don't bother to ask me to hang with them, only talking to me if they need help with school work. I always have to aim for high scores because I'm expected to and if I don't it means I fucked up even if I get an average score. There is so many different things running through my head that I just snapped today. Cried for a while. I don't even know why I'm typing this. I've never used reddit before. I just want to put this out there because I hide everything from everyone because I'm too scared of what they'll think.

I wanted to get out of my comfort zone a bit but it's beyond stressful and I can't manage it with my other organization, school, and work. Am I being too hard on myself and making excuses or should I take a step back before I burn myself out?

So a while ago, i meet this girl from FB Dating app, we started talking and when on a couple date. One day i decided to ask her to be my GF and she gladly said yes! So one day i went over to her house to spend time with her and she ask me to have sex with her and i agree to do it, and all i can say, she wasn't good at all. She kept putting her wrist  on my neck and was chocking me and i told her to stop. Afterwards, she got upset with me and told me to leave and said she didn't wanna speak to me anymore. Later that same night, i got a message on Facebook and she told me she was really sorry on how things went and i accepted her apology and started talking and hanging with her again. So today we was suppose to hang out at her office and go to the park afterwards to have lunch. So early this morning, i went to the store and brought snacks and things and when i got back home, i told her i was going to get there around 10:50, she wanted me there by 11. She told me to meet at her house and we'll walk to her office yesterday. So after i told her i was coming at 10:50 she started yelling at me over the phone for some reason and told me just come at 11:10 and i had no idea why she was so mad at me.. I just told her to message me when she was there. She message me and told me she wanted me there until 2, then she message me and told me that she wasn't there yet, than she told me she was waiting for people to leave. 30 minutes later, she told me forget it just don't come and stop answering the phone and replying to my messages

Post 628: Can someone just tell me what does stress and anxiety actually mean ?
Content:
Okay so as the title says can y'all define stress and anxiety. Also is anxiety related to being too curious everytime, thinking or daydreaming every now and then about something that you like. 

Basically I'm a 19 yo lean guy who just keeps dreaming in my own fantasy world...lol...and always be in the mood of being curious about certain things or just keep daydreaming whatever I like. Can this lead to stress ? Cause I've recently cought a cold for over a month !! (usually it used to go within 3 days to a week's span) and have been getting a bit of stomach aches from about a bit more than a week, and also have been feeling as if my stomach is full and my digestion has slowed down. The doctor pointed it out towards stress. 

I basically don't have any worries, hardly have any problems to think over, no fear about anything. So I've just been curious to know whether daydreaming or anything else stresses you up.

Post 630: How to explain that while being stressed isnt causing major issues yet, I know it will eventually.
Content:
I have been burnt out for months now, I go through cycles that start with being stressed and overwhelmed and end with me feeling suicidal and exhibiting a lot of depression symptoms.  Back in September I felt like the cycle was starting up again and tried to be proactive and get help from a counsellor/therapist.  

Since then I have seen 3 different people at 2 different places and nobody took me seriously.  I kept my request pretty simple, I want to find sress management techniques that dont involve mindfulness or meditation or anything like that.  I have practised mindfullness and meditation for nearly a decade and the results were extremely negative.  I figured that cant be the only way to manage stress, but it seems like everywhere I look it all says mindfulness.

My last appointment I tested in the green for streds despite feeling completely burnt out.  I feel like the test questions didnt represent my situation, but idk it was developed by professionals.  Guy #3 kept asking me what techniques I was using to manage my stress and I kept telling him I dont have any healthy coping mechanisms and even if I do they arent working well enough.

I can feel things just getting worse and part of me wants it to, so that maybe then I could say things like "I'm cant get out of bed" and not "well Im fine now but Im on the verge of not being able to get out of bed and I feel like shit all the time".  

How do I get a professional to take me seriously? Is mindfulness the only option for stress management? Thanks.

Post 637: How to prioritize your tasks so you never feel stressed by your busy schedule.
Content:
Hi Guys! Here is a quick and easy way to prioritize the things that matter so you can always feel like you have enough time in the day. This will greatly reduce the stress you have that is caused by feeling overly busy and "not having enough time."

Here are the steps:

1. Download and print out (or draw your own) the image attached to this post and hang it on your wall in your room, you will use it every week.
2. Every Sunday night, spend 15 minutes going through the tasks that you must do for the week, and place each task in the appropriate grid. Often times, the things that are ACTUALLY important are not what you would expect.
3. The only tasks that are actually important are ones that move you closer to your goals. Everything else is not important.
4. Don't do anything in the Unimportant/Not Urgent grid.
5. Plan when you are going to do the important tasks during your week. Make each task an event on your google calendar so that you are reminded and you don't forget. Check your calendar each morning so that you know the direction of your day.
6. Stay calm and stress free knowing that you have your time and your schedule under control :)

If you are stuck in a rut with getting this handled, I’d love to get inside YOUR head and hear more about your situation, and offer some insights that I’ve gained from speaking with countless people, my extensive research, and my own experience. You can hop on a free call with me (no strings attached) here: [https://calendly.com/balanced-life-call/30min](https://calendly.com/balanced-life-call/30min)

Post 638: Back from vacation and cried within the first 30 min.
Content:
I work in a clinic for very young children with autism. We're consistently under-staffed and the daily demands have made it that my time is dedicated to only managing safety. I have tons of new staff and no time to train them. My kids need individualized programs I have no time to write or train on. I went on vacation and was gone for 4 days this week to come back and learn about a significant crisis that happened the first day I was gone.  I hate feeling this way.

Post 639: Constant noise pollution contributing to chronic stress (can anyone relate??)
Content:
In the last few years of my life, in 3 different cities, I have somehow managed to live into neighborhoods where they tend to knock down houses to build multi-family / ugly looking Beatle juice houses that seem to take ages to complete (I guess it probably takes a lot of effort to hang up all those light fixtures on the cheap particle board?)

On top of that, the places I work are also constantly going under development as the on-site locations from my jobs tend to be in heavily-trafficked areas...It's gotten to a point where I can't ignore it anymore.

There's a project that went up to our surprise after a year of living here and no one in our complex has been able to park in front of our unit in over a year.  This morning they're working on the street for god knows what reason.

I know they're just doing their job, but I'm just venting and wondering if anyone has similar experiences or if I'm just being too sensitive. I've been dealing with a lot of emotional pain recently due to the death of a few loved ones and it's been making it very difficult for me to work, to begin with. After taking two days off and feeling ready to dive back into work, I sat down at my desk at home with a cup of coffee and immediately the jackhammers down the alley started. I just don't know what to do about this anymore. There doesn't seem to be any place you can live with limited income to escape the constant traffic, fire sirens and construction work.

I've been taking my son out for hikes in parks in the weekend and sure that is great for getting away from it all, but how the fuck do I continue to deal with this and be productive?

It's almost like even if I can block the noise out, my the part of my brain responsible for detecting the noise is still active and irritated.

Unfortunately, I'm a technical writer and find music/podcasts just as distracting. I have tried going to coffee shops and libraries to work but I find those environments hard to focus and don't want to have to go out of the way of my own house just to get some quiet.

I meditate daily, run, and do light yoga which helps me find peace of mind, but I'm finding of 8\~ years of this constant noise to be harder and harder to take.

Post 641: I’m so stressed and tired.
Content:
I’m (15F) graduating senior high next year. I’ve been stressed out about University and majors for a long time but it’s gotten worse lately. I constantly feel like I’m not good enough for the major I want to choose (Architecture) because I’m not brilliant at maths. When my tutor of almost 5 years was asked about my compatibility with Architecture major he replied that he doesn’t think I’m a good fit. According to him, I’m not good at logical thinking and problem solving and my friend would be a better fit for the major than I am. Everytime I want to be confident, his words just repeats itself in my head and I can’t stop hating myself for not being smart enough. I can’t stop feeling frustrated because it feels like no matter how diligent I become, all I am is diligent. I hated the fact that he was correct about me not being smart enough. I just can’t stop doubting and hating myself more than before now. I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m just so tired of everything.

Post 643: Work is giving me stress
Content:
I get criticised every week and I've only been here about a month. They're saying my customer service is bad because I don't know where the things in the shop are when someone asks me. And they're saying I don't stock the shelves enough and that's cause I'm serving customers. The manager was saying that my colleagues were complaining about me and it makes me feel shit and now I feel that I can't trust anyone who I work with. I try my best at the job but I'm still criticised. I also feel I have too many responsibilities because I was left to close the shop on my own. And I'd been left with all the deliveries to put on the shelves so I didn't have time to brush the floor. I got my mum to come in and help with cleaning and a coworker had to come in to give me keys to close up and they spied on me and told me off for getting my mum to help. I'm just so annoyed with everything and the job gives me a lot of stress already and the manager is adding to it. I feel like I can't trust anyone at the job and I really hate it.

Post 646: Can stress make you pale, tired, and cause weight loss?
Content:
I've been going through a rather stressful period for the past 6 months, and since then I've lost weight - at one point I was struggling to eat, was feeling sick every time I ate - I'm feeling and looking tired all of the time, and I've become very pale. I'm pale anyway, I'm fair skinned, but I've been described as being translucent of late. I am eating more now, but I'm not really putting any weight on. I'm slim naturally, so right now I'm just looking like skin and bones.

I seem to be more susceptible to illness as well. I keep catching colds, and I had a bout of food poisoning, all within the same month. 

My bowel habits are off, too. I'm going as normal, but it's always soft. 

I'm going the doctors next week, but a little worried in case these aren't symptoms of stress, and it's something else.

Post 647: Help coping with extreme, long term stress? I'm going crazy
Content:
Hi,

I'm 18, and I've been non stop stressed since mid-March. It started during spring break, when all of my roommates went home except for me. I'm really bad at being alone. It made me so anxious and stressed that I got the flu and a severe UTI, as well as abdominal pain. Later, because I was stressed about the UTI, I got really bad chest pain. Then, I started my first major curriculum class, which stressed me out because the teacher was tough and I was the only freshman. Then we had to choose housing and there wasn't enough housing for every student (good job, school), so that had me freaking out pretty horribly. Then, it was time to move out of the freshman dorms, which was a bit overwhelming.

In May, my dad told me that he was selling his house, and he wasn't very nice about it. I'm really emotionally attached to that house, so that's stressing me out a lot too. The thought of leaving it makes me want to just lay down on the floor and cry (in fact, I have done so), and he's not being sympathetic at all (as in, when I get sad about it he tells me to grow the hell up). So that's a *constant* stresser.

THEN, my dad and my aunt got in a massive fight, and my dad pulled out of helping me buy my plane ticket to visit her in LA. My friends had already gotten their tickets, and I had to find a way to get mine on my own (my place of work closed in January, and I need so much time off this summer that nobody in their right mind would hire me). All the while, I was caught right in the middle of their insane argument. I got really close to cancelling the trip. That was the catalyst for my current predicament, I think.

I am currently sick, and I have been for two weeks. I feel horrible all of the time, and get nauseous and dizzy after eating. My heartbeat skyrockets, and I get really shaky too. I saw my GP, and after a physical examination, she chalked it up to all of the stress coming down pretty hard on me.

I can't keep letting this stress rule over me like this. It's literally making me sick. What are some ways that I can go about coping with it and keeping it from kicking me to the ground like this? I've gotta do something.

I am on medication, but since it's a new prescription, it's going to be a month or so before I see any real improvement.

Post 648: Anyone here deals with stress being a doctor?
Content:
I've recently graduated and got my MBBS degree to practice as a GP. As per our rules here, I've to do internship for 12months at all the subspecialties so that we can provide medical care to any patient at any time. So I've to work everywhere including ER or Critical Care or at ICUs and stuff.

So there have been patients which were really in bad shape and some of them died. I mean, you get sensitized after a while but it does end up adding to the constant stress at the end of the day. I've become depressed, dealing with anxiety issues, sometimes it's real hard for me to control my temper. I realize I've become less nice as a person and more a cold one. But it does hurt me at the end cuz all of my day's work kinda suffocate me. Also, I'm highly competitive and somewhat of a perfectionist so I'm really stressed about my career too.

Does anyone know how to deal with this?
I never drink (religious issues), never had drugs, have a few close friends but don't know how to share this with them cuz it's always "Get over it". 
Any suggestion, any at all - is welcome.

Edit: I'm a woman and I work crazy hours. It varies from 50- 70 hours or more depending on my shift schedule - night and day. So yes, might be a case of burnout too.

Does stress at work cause depression?

&#x200B;

today, I love my job, I'm at the end of the fourth week and it has been a really stressful time over four weeks, and the reason it's stressful is that I hadn't worked for a little while and I'm doing a job that's quite a bit more senior then what I've been doing for a while.

&#x200B;

I'm leading a team, and I'm juggling many things at the moment, I've got stakeholders, I've got employees, I've got processes to learn, and it's quite hard, there's a lot for me to learn.

&#x200B;

but I think, that's one of the things that helps depression for me, is that when I've got a lot to learn, that's when I grow and when I'm thrown in the deep end, that's when I swim.

&#x200B;

today, I am grateful for a challenging job / personal growth

&#x200B;

What are you grateful for?

*This is part of my 365 days of gratitude to work through my depression and the spiral into suicide attempts over the last two years. I have been posting a video daily on Youtube and Facebook on my journey to get out of Depression 'Gratitude Bridge'*

Post 650: Gained 4kg in the past 4 months.
Content:
Hi, I’ve (F17) always been around 45 kg. I never gained much weight. Even when I ate double lunches, I would remain 45 kg. Fast forward a couple months, I’m 49 kg. College apps are nearing and my predicted grades determine my acceptance offers from my UK universities. I’m a very type A personality, and I usually just work harder during times of high pressure/stress. 

It’s strange that I started gaining weight a while after I stopped eating double lunches. I don’t know what to do. I’m not the type to break down or cry from stress either. 

I am quite calm and collected, but I do think of what I must achieve and what I must do daily.

She is my mother, so yes, I love her. But I would always prefer to be somewhere where she is not. It is bad for my mental health to be around her. She is a very manipulative, toxic person and I am miserable whenever I am with her. The problem is, she is my mother, so I have to stay with her until I turn 17/18. She is taking me out of school tomorrow and Friday and also spring break. We are going on vacation (which I hate going with her and my older sister) to a place in SC. I’m honestly terrified to be away from my friends for this long. I hope I can change my mindset about this, but honestly, I doubt I will be able to.

Post 653: I just can't seem to handle this anymore
Content:
I'm a sophomore in high school. I get good greats, participate etc. etc. But I feel so over worked this semester. I'm part of the school show and this is our tech week. I feel like it should be a Friday but its only Tuesday, I had two projects due yesterday for my Honors Humanities courses, neither of which I was able to get finished due to the tech week. On top of that I play JV tennis (First year), do scouting (5th year), take tap dancing lessons (11th year), and practice both Piano (12th year) and Violin (8th year). And not to brag but I do them all quite well. I run all A s in high school with the occasional B in math. But I just feel like my way of life is falling apart around my ears. And that's just the first level of stress. The second level is both stress and fear. Myself and a group of people have been running a in depth study of the death of Michael Hastings. And its finally getting to me. I myself have poured in over 600 hours on this project since mid December acting as a defacto leader for the group since we have no proper administration. We are intending to go public relatively soon and its finally started to hit home just how deep we are into this project. You could say that this project is the root of all my stress. So the logical thing to do would be to leave the project quietly. And that's where we hit the problem. If I where to back down from this now, not only would it have been a tremendous waste of my time, it would also be similar to if I saw someone preform a fatal hit and run, I saw the licences plate, got a picture of it, but then decided to not give the picture to authorities. I've always been the kind of person who manages their emotions well, (that's why I'm an admin on several discord servers, I don't discriminate and I don't favor any parties), but as of late I feel like I'm always on the verge of breaking down, stopping whatever I'm doing and just crying until I can't anymore. I haven't quite been able to pinpoint why I want to cry so hard, but its getting to the point where I'm occasionally tearing up over the simplest phrases like, "how's your day going". Please someone help.

Post 654: Can stress affect memory and focus?
Content:
This is probably a dumb question, but I feel so dumb recently. I was the best in my grade at science, maths and extension science last year but now I'm in year 11. I make so many dumb mistakes. 

I did a formative, missing 5 of 27 marks on the dumbest of things. Most of the time about half of my work is wrong because of dumb mistakes. 

My memory is also worse, from the point that I could remember most things without studying them, now I forget how to do it within days without study.

This leads to more stress because I think I'm getting dumber and there might be something wrong with my brain (thanks health anxiety). I've been more stressed recently and was also more than usual stressed last year when it began. 

Is it common for these sorts of things to happen with stress? 


Post 655: New job, fear of being the new person making stupid mistakes
Content:
I started a new job recently (now working two jobs) and I am feeling weirdly anxious and stressed about it. I didn't have this feeling for my other job when I first started. I just feel really anxious the night before work and feel like I'm the new person who might make a stupid mistake and annoy everyone. I'm guessing it's because I feel less confident in this area than I do in my other job, but I don't know how to get over it. I just hate being the new person and am having trouble sleeping each night because I can't stop thinking about all the things that might go wrong at work tomorrow. And most of all, I can't stop stressing about what my co-workers think of me. Any tips to get over these types of fears?

Couple of days ago I was at the ER. I felt my heart beat faster, was lightheaded, short of breath and had high BP. Doctor said I had normal test results and said it might have been due to stress.

Post 658: I can’t stop clenching my jaw!!
Content:
Hello,

Bear with me as this is my first post. 

I have suffered from stress for the past few weeks. I have had a lot of different symptoms but the jaw clenching is the worst!

I have tried pain killers, anti-inflammatories, and massaging my jaw but nothing seems to help for more than a couple of minutes. 

I don’t seem to do it in my sleep - only during the day. And I feel relaxed when it happens so can’t seem to understand why I’m doing it.

If anybody has any advice that would be great, thank you 😊

Post 659: Losing my house but I’m going to be okay
Content:
Dear kind souls of Reddit, 

I am furious and under a huge amount of stress right now , but I am going to be okay. I would appreciate some words of wisdom and good vibes going my way. 

I bought a mobile home on its own lot in 2016. I got the home inspected prior to purchasing it and I got house insurance and title insurance. After I moved in, I began to have problems with the water line freezing and breaking every winter.  I have spent around $4,000 in repairs over the past two years and I think I have finally solved the problem. My sewer stopped working properly in March of this year and I have had to dismantle most of the sewer underneath the house to solve the problem.  The plumber and I put a camera down and we found an unknown blockage somewhere close to the street. I ended up having to dig up my driveway, break the sewer and put the camera through....only to find that the sewer is clean. The sewer cleaner said that it was probably frozen and he has been to my house to thaw the sewer when the previous owners owned it. In order to fix the broken pipe, the plumber is going to have to dig down underneath the mobile home to connect to the iron sewer that is under there, and in order to do this, I will have to completely remove my house, fix the sewer, and then put my house back on my property. The total bill for this will be around $10,000 and it is at the point where I am ready to just get a new house. I will be living paycheck to paycheck in a new house, but I don’t really have many options. 

I would not have bought this house if I had known all of the problems that came with it and insurance won’t cover any of this. I have proof that the previous owners knew about the water line freezing, but I have no proof that they knew anything about the sewer freezing. I haven’t been able to sleep properly for several months, I am under so much stress, and I am furious. I have been living in a hotel since March while I am still stuck paying a mortgage on property tax on a house that I can’t live in. 

Why does the world work this way?

Content:
Many things have happened in just 7 days.

I broke up with my boyfriend, it was a toxic relationship lasted a year.
Even tho it was all toxic I miss him, to distract myself I should hang out with people, but honestly.. I'm not good with people. I don't have lots of friends, and they are not even good..

My third year in high school is ending and it's really stressful with last tests. I have 3 more weeks to go but it feels like eternity.

I decided that I will study more to get a 3.0 GPA so that I can access to college. But to attend college in America.. I will go there and live by my own. So all these thoughts are making me exhausted.

I feel like I want to isolate myself more than I already am. Like, as soon as I finish my school day, I'll head home and try to relax. I don't want to see anyone and talk to anyone. My mother said that it's been too much time since I actually made a real smile, not a fake one.

It's just that I have priorities (like college) and I can't seem to mantain friendships because I'm so emotionally beaten down and stressed.

I see everyone like an enemy now: I started to dislike everyone for their shitty behavior. Everyone is just so annoying and kinda mean these days.

It's also me whom is messed up with emotions and ugh.. how do I just cope with all these emotions and all this stuff?

Post 663: My mom keeps laughing at me whenever I get upset
Content:
So today I got really upset because my mom called the electric company a long time ago and they came today about our bill, my mom denied it was us who called. He asked the other neighbors and he was asking for the apartment that called them about the bill, he said that they had low income so they were trying to see if they can figure out what to do with the bill or something along those lines. (So my mom tried telling them that after using the heater ONCE in the winter, the bill was $300) After hearing that, I told my Mom about it. We have low income because my mom is the only one working and she doesn’t have her green card yet, our dad also left us so it’s harder for her to clean houses for money. So anyways I told my mom that we could’ve saved money. She said it doesn’t matter, I told her that I know that my mom can’t earn money. That’s why I always try to find ways to save money. I’m only 12 and Im aware  going through puberty so I get mad easily. I was shouting back, asking her why she never tried to save money. She doesn’t respond and starts laughing at me, I’ve been getting stressed out a lot this past week and my mom just doesn’t help. She laughs whenever I get stressed, she tries to communicate to others about useless things with her extremely broken English, and she keeps using her money on useless things. Overall I’m fine with all the other things but I just get way more stressed when my mom keeps laughing at me when I get upset. It is unlikely for me not to start crying when she starts laughing. She then starts laughing at me even more, I’m having second thoughts on her being a nice person. I’m starting to think that she bullied others, all I know is that my mom fought with other kids to be at a “higher level” of a clique, a leader, I remember her telling me about a mark on her back from fighting. I know I went off topic a bit while typing this but I’m just really annoyed that my mom laughs at my stress and calls me insane for shouting. I’ve tried many times, asking her not to laugh at me while I’m stressed out, it never works. I have no idea how to make her stop, I was wondering if anyone could suggest anything to make my mom listen.

1 week til my apartment's lease is up and my husband and I have to be out.  No idea where we will go. We have been looking at apartments and houses for a month straight and found nothing that fits what we need. I've been so stressed out I've made myself physically sick a couple mornings before work. I cry most evenings, before I fall asleep on the couch at 8pm from pure exhaustion of being stressed, work and packing. 

Just desperately need something positive to happen right now.


Update!  We found a place!  Went just a bit further out of where we were looking (45 minute commute) and found a perfect house to rent, fits our style and needs, and most importantly , our budget. Just needed help with the deposit, and my husbands boss was willing to help us with it. Things do get better. 

Post 667: I'm making mistakes at work. My anxiety is getting worse. Can't sleep or eat.
Content:
Hi r/stress,


I've only just come across this sub now and sorry if I am posting completely the wrong kind of post but I just need to get this off my chest as I can't really talk to anyone about it. Here goes. 

I started a job in my ideal sector at the end of April, and was so thrilled when I landed the job and received a lot of praise from my manager about how amazingly qualified I was and how my application/interview was amazing. I really felt I got off to a great start. After working in dead end jobs since college I was finally happy and proud of my position. 

The field is very creative. I spend most of my days writing and creating concepts for my clients. I am left to my own devices and have to reach a target by months end for each of my clients. Here's where my anxiety is coming from... I am really struggling with my organisation and its really having a negative impact on my work. 

My team is based in one location and I work in tandem with a team in another location. I deal directly with the clients and it is on me to inform my colleagues of updates. I am forgetful when I get stuck into a project and an error I had made by not informing my colleage that a client had approved some work set the whole team back by over two weeks, increased my client's workload by 10 hours and ultimately cost the company money as those extra 10 hours of work aren't being paid for by the client. My manager was really exasperated with me today, and couldn't believe I had made such a simple mistake. I can't either. I spent the day in extreme bouts of anxiety or sitting in the break room solo trying to regulate my breathing. The team expanded four weeks after I started and the new girl is coping so well. I am terrified there is a huge X on my back. 

As part of a company quality review one of my clients was looked at. It had been handed over to me by a colleague who left and had not been properly handed over so there were elements that were not resolved e.g. a note said something was unfinished, which I presumed was unfinished by my colleague in another location, but instead was intended for me to pick up but I didn't realise. The review was given publically in front of the team and I felt so humiliated for not having a good system in place. It was the first company review and in hindsight I feel like one of the more experienced staff should have been targeted first so I could learn from their review, but all the same I feel like this was mistake number 1 in my manager's head. With this second mistake today she even said that I shouldn't have missed up 'again' and I'm so sick even thinking of our conversation that I want to throw up. She told me my work is very good, but things are getting lost and I just died inside. 

I spent the day reviewing every client, every email I had sent them or the colleague to see if other mistakes had been made and I found two incredibly similar mistakes on two other clients. I have since tried to resolve both of them by emailing my overseas colleague but not I'm terrified it will come up with management and I'll be in even hotter water. I have created checklists and I even work in the evenings at home to try to get the best for my clients, but my best work is being wasted due to my inability to organise myself. 

It is after midnight here and my heart feels like it will pound through my chest. I can't really speak to my SO about it (definitely not about the additional mistakes I found) as I'm so afraid that they'll be cross at me for not being as excellent at this job as I originally thought I was. To be honest, I've been close to tears all day but can't contain it. 

I work really, really hard but still feel like the biggest fuck up in the history of my company and that I'll be let go after my six month probation. I spoke to my colleagues today about my feelings and the general consensus was that everyone makes mistakes and that we shouldn't have to babysit our colleagues overseas as they should be aware of work in the pipeline as should ask/remind me but that goes both ways and I really shouldn't have issues with organisation. There are a number of checklists in work and policy changes almost every second day so I'm really struggling. 

I'm so sorry for the wall of text. I just had to offload that. I know that I'm a total fuck up at work and its making me sick to my stomach when I know I'm not as good as they want. All I can picture is them thinking of the other candidates at my interview who they should have hired.

Post 669: Too stressed. 
Content:
So they say a little stress is good for us. Makes us work well under pressure etc. But I just don't get that kind of stress. For example at work when things get on top of me I tend to just freak out. My job involves a lot of lifting and shifting, so it is also physically demanding. It starts to make me look bad, as when people come to ask me for things I have become very dismissive and this isnt like me.

I have had cognitive behavioural therapy (privately) for anxiety/stress/depression and it did work a little. But when I'm at work I can't really use the techniques I was taught. 

I have started getting headaches. I also used to be on beta blockers for high blood pressure (and im only 21). 

Any suggestions on how to go forward? I don't want to go see the doctor because I don't want to have any psychological problems on my health records. Looks kind of bad. Sometimes I think about meds, but i've had substance abuse issues in the past so i would rather not go back there.

Hope you are all doing well. :) xx

Post 670: This is how I (finally) got rid of stress (and anxiety).
Content:
I wanted to share something that worked for me to get rid of 20+ years of intense stress and anxiety.

I‘m 55 and I have wrestled with this since my 20’s, and it took a major breakdown for me to find what worked and what didn‘t, when it truly came down to it.

I’m now stronger than I have ever been, and panic attacks aren‘t even a “thing” anymore. And anxiety isn’t really something I have dealt with at all much since I‘ve used what I call the “formula.”

(I've used this on myself, and others who I have shown it to have done rather well with it, also...)

1. Your Subconscious "mind" is more than just thoughts that are under the surface - there are feelings, too.
2. If these feelings don't discharge as they come up, they can collect in your system.
3. If you get triggered by something, what gets "triggered" is all of this subconscious stored emotional energy that hits you and knocks you and balanced and robs you of your peace.
4. Getting rid of this subconscious stored emotional energy seems to be the ticket to getting peace and balance back.

So, that's the "formula" for why you get increasing anxiety and stress (and overwhelm) that didn't happen when you were younger, because the energy builds up. It's also why it gets worse over time, because it collects in your system.

This is normal.

*There's nothing wrong with you.*

It's simply a matter of getting this energy back to the point where you were young and you didn't have any of it collected.

Now, THIS is the formula that is having the best results with people who are using it, and it certainly did with me, since I used to have anxiety and panic attacks for much of 25 years.

(I'm pretty unshakable now.)

The formula:

**Use an energy therapy to "target" your personal subconscious triggers.**

*That's it.*

That's the fastest formula that I've seen in my 40 year obsession with the subconscious mind and trying to get rid of my own intense anxiety and panic attacks.

Here's the energy therapies that I used, got very good at, and used to train people on (I still do on at least one), and I know at least one ha a free intro guide:

(Note: the order is my experience in what is least effective to the most effective.)

\* The Release Technique/The Sedona Method - This was my first exposure to this stuff. These two methods are slow & sometimes painful, but they proved the formula that got me relief when other things didn't.

[https://www.releasetechnique.com/](https://www.releasetechnique.com/)

[https://www.sedona.com/Home.asp](https://www.sedona.com/Home.asp)

\* EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) - This was effective, but awkward. It worked best on specific things, but not on more general themes (anxiety).

[https://eftuniverse.com/](https://eftuniverse.com/)

\* TAT (Tapas Acupressure Technique) - This worked well on general anxiety, but it's not something you'd want to do in public.

[https://tatlife.com/](https://tatlife.com/)

\* BSFF (Be Set Free Fast) - A more discreet way to help with anxiety relief, but the results weren't consistent.

[https://www.besetfreefasttraining.com/](https://www.besetfreefasttraining.com/)

\* The zPoint Process - A faster version of the above, but with inconsistent results.

[https://www.acceptingself.com](https://www.acceptingself.com)

\* Inner Influencing - The method that I used (and still do) to go all of the way. It's simple and fast to do. (And easy, once you learn it.)

[https://www.innerinfluencing.com/](https://www.innerinfluencing.com/)

I went from trying all of the traditional things, including the typical self help techniques like visualization or even meditation, and nothing really worked until I started to apply the formula of energy therapies and subconscious targeting.

Any of these should help, but please note that they are in order from slowest and most difficult to the fastest, easiest, and most "gentle" on your system.

I'm okay with any questions.

I hope this helps someone like it did me.

* Paul

Post 671: Can you feel ok but actually have unhealthy amounts of stress in your life?
Content:
I don't know a lot about stress, apart from the physical feeling of being stressed in any given moment about any particular reason.

I've had some financial stress, that has lingered for quite some time, If I were to tell myself do I feel stressed? I would say every now and then when I think about it.

But also this financial thing has been an issue and has stressed me out for so long now, That I think I'm actually probably always secretly stressed about it... Or at least know it's a pressure point.

And maybe I've just learned to live with it.. But the stress is still their and it's catching up to me, and potentially causing health issues.

Can you be unhealthy stressed, without feeling physically feeling stressed? 

Post 672: How to deal with stress without weed?
Content:

I'm in a really transitional period of my life. My girlfriend is 5 months pregnant, I just broke the lease on my apartment and moved in with my girlfriends mother, I just bought a new car, and I'm starting a new job on Monday. A lot of things are changing very rapidly.

It makes sense that I'm stressed. I've been dealing with a lot of constant stress, including all of the other problems I've had before these changes.

I feel like normally I handle things pretty well. But lately everything has been getting to me. Every new form of stress seems to be amplified and my whole world seems like it's ending. Even though I always figure everything out, lately it feels like every new stressor is "my last straw" of sorts.

I haven't smoked weed in 2/3 weeks because of this new job. I can smoke again since I was hired but I kinda don't want to until I learn to handle this stress better. Idk if my lack of handling everything well is directly related to me not smoking, but I feel like it's playing a factor. Before this, I haven't been sober in 4-5 years.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Any advice?

Post 673: my sister and i built this mental self-care app outside a chemo room, and now we want to share it with those who can benefit 🤍🫡
Content:
hey reddit,

over the past couple of years, i've navigated through a stressful time. i was balancing jobs, processing a painful breakup, and dealing with the shock of my mom’s late-stage cancer diagnosis. even though i seemed fine and was functioning well on the outside (trying my best to bring comfort and hope to the family, etc.), i was emotionally exhausted. to cope, my sister and i began helping each other reframe our thoughts and offering the outside perspectives the other needed. this has allowed us to navigate challenges with clarity without ignoring our own needs and feelings.

however, we realized we couldn’t always be there for one another. so, outside the chemo room, we started to build **Thinking Lens** \[website: thinkinglens.app\], an app to help anyone reframe thoughts for better problem-solving and mental wellbeing. inside the app, you can brain dump your feelings and thoughts and be recommended a set of powerful lenses to view your situation differently. (for example, you may gain the 'self-compassion lens' when you're being too harsh on yourself). going beyond recommendations, it handholds you to apply the perspectives to your situation/story right away.

born out of our own needs to navigate everyday challenges with clarity and wellbeing, we continue to build Thinking Lens with care and intention. it’s now built alongside advisory support from leading clinical and research institutes. it’s also appreciated by several mental health professionals eager to recommend it. we’re now in our private beta and would love to offer some free spots. if you think you can use this app as extra support and give us your honest feedback, please DM me. iOS users will get an install link, while Android users will be among the first to get notified when the Android version is available.

thanks for reading this and for considering joining our mission to make reframing thoughts and everyday mental self-care easier and more accessible!

Post 675: Consumed by stress
Content:
I always find myself stressed. I can't do anything because I'm stressed things will go bad, and most of the time they do. Every time I tried to work on improving my skills, something happens that causes me to stress out. I tried losing weight many times but the minute I get used to the routine something happens and it takes me months to recover from the stress it caused. It feels like every time I try to manage my life, something happens and undo all the progress I've done.
I had to move from my house and my country due to war last year. Thankfully, I managed to find a job here but I found out the company might close in the next months. 
I don't feel like I'm stable enough to make any kind of life choices and I'm stressed out about what will happen in the future. I don't see any good in the future but I'm also stressed out about being stressed out. 
Any idea how to manage stress for just a little bit? I feel lost and helpless. 

Post 676: Random panic, always feels the need to be doing something in moments of rest?
Content:
Hello everyone, looking for some advice as to have to cope with stress more efficiently.
I am a young woman who is balancing between a full-time job and a part-time job, I’m constantly financially stressed, and have some health issues that contribute to not feeling good half of the time, and given the amount of work I must do to keep myself afloat I am not allowed to much time to rest.

I am currently taking the time and looking for a more sustainable job so that I can live my life, not just work through it. With me making these changes and putting forth effort to have some time for myself, I find that when I have moments of nothing to do, I just feel overwhelmed.

Legitimately, I could work on a hobby of mine, or do something fun but it stresses me out to the point where I would just rather lay on the couch and scroll on my phone for some simple dopamine. I want to be better, but even doing anything that I enjoy stresses me out. It’s like it’s too quiet, and I keep myself busy with things that need to be done, or clean so that I can avoid doing nothing.

Another thing that I’ve noticed, is that when I’m in a peaceful environment we’re nothing could possibly go wrong, my body goes into panic mode. Just recently I took the time and money to give myself a nice haircut, normally I cut it myself.

Anyways, when I was on the chair, getting a really nice scalp massage and closing my eyes, I just felt anxious. I get these moments where I feel like I have to fight my body from lurching up from the chair and running out of the whole place. It’s like I imagine it happening in my mind and I just going to full panic mode even though I know I’m safe.

It hasn’t inhibited my life too much, however the thoughts are unpleasant. I am able to cope and call myself down, however I just get confused as to why my body reacts the way that it does.

I have been in flight mode for a week now. I avoided EVERYTHING related to my school/work. Even avoided nonthreatening situations like doing my sister a favor, replying to messages and calls. I didn't want to deal with anything. I've missed all my classes this week. I am so behind in school. I don't know what I'm doing. I have no sense of urgency. I dont care whether I have homework due tomorrow or next week. I have no sense of consequence. I feel like I'm pressured in all directions of my life. I know this is bad and I don't know what to do. 

This happened to me a lot of times the past few months. I will always have a week or two where I do nothing. I'm diagnosed with depression but currently not seeing a therapist and I don't think I can for now because I couldn't afford it.

2. Messing up a guitar part in a song I'm recording (FUCK SAKE WHY WON'T THE FUCKING THING DO WHAT I TELL IT TO DO)
3. Burnt some toast. I had definitely felt something in my neck.
4. Forgetting my bottle of water and having to walk back a whole 30 seconds to my flat to get it.
5. Too many people in the swimming pool (there wasn't that many, maybe 6 or 7?)
6. Some young woman saying "like" too much on a phone call.
7. Missed a bus and had to wait a whole 5 minutes for the next one (wasn't in a rush anyway)
8. My mum phoning me (JUST SEND A FUCKING TEXT... also see point 1.)

This isn't healthy, it's like I burnt myself out from my actually stressful life, lost my wife, my house, my job, and now I'm just stressed out of habit. I'm unemployed, live with my parents, and all things considered my life is not stressful at all. The little work I do do doesn't stress me out.

Is anyone else here stressed about nothing of consequence?

Post 682: Struggling with Anxiety and Perfectionism in New Job, Need Advice
Content:
Hey everyone,
  
I'm reaching out because I'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed and anxious about my new job, and I could really use some advice.
  
I've always been a perfectionist, and I've been proud of my dedication and dependability in all of my previous roles. In fact, I've frequently found myself covering for lazy coworkers and managers who couldn't be bothered doing their jobs correctly on time. While they appreciated my dedication, it frequently left me exhausted and stressed, but it was also nice to feel appreciated for being useful and worthwhile.
  
I recently got a new job that seemed like a dream come true. It offered higher pay and more personal control over shift times, work attire, and personal device use, which I thought would be an excellent fit for me, as I'd always felt limited in that area in previous jobs. However, since starting the job a week ago, I've discovered that it's far more stressful and demanding than I expected.
  
I'm struggling to keep up with the workload while trying to learn all of the necessary information, which also changes weekly. My new coworkers have been helpful in answering my questions, but they've also been brutally honest about constantly being confronted with new challenges such as difficult daily targets, toxic managers, and a lack of HR support. I find myself arriving early, staying late, and even foregoing my lunch breaks in an attempt to catch up, but it never seems to be enough for me.
   
To make matters worse, the stress and anxiety have started to take a toll on my physical health. I've been having trouble sleeping and eating due to IBS flare-ups, and I feel like I'm constantly on edge.
  
I've talked to friends and family about how I'm feeling, and they've suggested that I need to stop putting so much pressure on myself to be the perfect workhorse and start slacking like the rest of the people I've worked with. But the thought of not doing my job properly really terrifies me, and I can't shake the feeling that if I don't catch up, I'll be reprimanded by my manager or fired instantly.
  
I know I need to strike a balance and prioritise my mental health, but I'm not sure where to begin. How can I stop being anxious and become more relaxed and carefree like some of my former coworkers? I despise feeling like I'm failing at my job, but I also dislike feeling like I'm falling apart when I come home. And quitting is not an option because it took me so long to find a decent paying job in my area.
  
Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Content:
I think a combination of work, master classes, low financial income, high bills, chronic Asthma, and birth control causing  constant bleeding is making me sick all the time.I also have low vitamins D so that doesn’t help.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I am 28 and I honestly feel so much older. My body just doesn’t know how to function at a normal level anymore. I can feel myself breaking down. I know everyone has stress in their life so I’m not trying to say my stress is more than others…I just feel like I have a particular combination of negatives That is really driving me down…

I don’t know how to alleviate my stress… I love my job! I absolutely wouldn’t change it for anything but it is very demanding mentally, I am getting my masters in the field to progress in the field, and have some  financial success as well.  However I’m constantly being expose to germs and clearly my body can’t handle it.

I had so many snow days last week and as soon as I go back to work just for two days I get sneezed on …peed on, coughed on etc…. Now I’m sick.

Right now this year I made maybe 15-20k….. and it’s not like I don’t have bills I do. So much so that I have racked up 10k in credit cards just to get by….

I know I should crack down on some going out to eat and going out with friends but these things are what offer the few moments of relief I have from the grind and it’s hard to give it up. I have already starting using an app to track my spending….

My masters classes are going well but also cause me an insane amount of stress.

I have dealt with asthma since childhood. As an Adult tried Steroids but Couldn’t afford them anymore. That helped alleviate my use of the pump. But I still have at least one attack a month. 

I have tried several BC methods and other than a cyst on my ovaries have no other reason to be bleeding heavily… I would go back for another sonogram but I can’t financially afford it right now. The last one cost me $700 even after insurance. I can’t just stop the BC because I want that extra measure of protection. But my body seems to suffer from this. Right now I’ve been bleeding for a month straight, and heavy, with so much pain.

You know how in life there are steps you can take to alleviate stress…. I don’t feel like I have anyway to alleviate mine. I can’t talk to anyone…or at least not anyone too much before they’ll stop listening or worry about their one stress and not have time for mine….

I can’t seem to find more immediate ways to alleviate my stress other then thinking about my future career that will at least financially alleviate some stress, but that still about a year or more away.

What are some of your ways you alleviate stress?

Post 686: 3 strategies to cope with stress during life transitions
Content:
Going through a life transition can be stressful and overwhelming, especially if you have multiple responsibilities for family, work, community, and more. Balancing all these aspects while finding time for self-care can be challenging.  
  
To better manage your stress, it is essential to improve your time management. In terms of time allocation, I encourage you to begin by addressing your distractions. Take a moment to reflect on the distractions that may be hindering your progress in life. Identify them and consider how you can let go of these distractions. This becomes particularly crucial during times of significant life changes when your old routines or patterns have been disrupted. Prioritize by focusing on one task at a time. Determine what is most important at the moment and let go of less urgent matters.  
  
The second key strategy is to establish a daily routine for self-care, even if it is as short as 30, 20, or 10 minutes. Dedicate this time to activities that bring you peace and calm, such as reading, journaling, nature walks, yoga, or meditation. Consistently follow this routine daily to recharge. Taking breaks and slowing down can enhance long-term efficiency and productivity.  
  
**Stress is not solely a result of our actions; it is also influenced by our thoughts. Overthinking can lead to stress and feeling overwhelmed. One effective method to reduce stress is to reframe your thoughts and let go of overthinking.** Practice mindfulness by focusing on the present moment, avoiding worries about the future, or dwelling on the past. When you catch yourself contemplating the past or future, pause, become aware of those thoughts, and redirect your focus to the present moment. Being mindful of everything around you and expressing gratitude.  
  
**Stress can be a signal that it’s time to let go — let go of distractions, unimportant matters, and negative thoughts. By releasing these attachments, you create space for your mind to rest and quiet down, breaking free from the captivity of stress.** Letting go makes you feel lighter and more liberated.

Post 688: Stress Illness?
Content:
Don't use reddit much, I hope I'm in the right spot. My question I want discussion with is: Is stress illness/sickness a real thing?

TLDR: I am so stressed it seems like every weekend I get ill.

 I've Googled it and it's not exactly what I mean. For context I am going through a lot in my personal life with an ending marriage and introverted to the point the thought of making any friends causes me anxiety and stress. For work I recently took over for someone that retired. I'm an instructor at a technical college, so with this change I not only am teaching new classes, but also took over as the head of our program, and have a brand new instructor leaning on me for support and advice (he took over the classes I used to teach). I have a ton on my plate to put it lightly, there are days where I don't get more than 10 minutes to eat lunch. I am beyond stressed during the week, then it seems like every weekend I get physically sick. Sometimes just a sore throat, or runny nose, but this week it's bad- full flu symptoms. I don't struggle with allergies ever and getting sick here and there makes sense but it consistently has been happening every weekend since the start of the semester (about 4 weeks ago). 

I already know I need to work on stress management, I was just curious if this has happened to anyone else or am I being stupid?

Content:
Hello!

I'm someone who always liked to say I never stress. Each time a stressful situation comes, I tend to say "it's a bummer, but I can deal with this later/take it easy".

I only realized recently that I have "invisible" stress.  What I mean by this is that at first I don't have outward symptoms of stress, I can stay calm and positive. But it's brewing inside. 

Of course,all this unresolved stress just end up overflowing.

Last night was the worse. Woke up feeling like I haven't slept and then realized I had a sleepwalking episode (things weren't in the right place, cupboards open,...)

What should I do with all this pent-up stress? Should I see someone?

How do I deal with stress before it gets too much? How do I recognize the internalized stress?

Thank you in advance for the advice!

Post 693: How to manage multifaceted longterm burnout while also maintaining college and hobbies?
Content:
Hello, please let me knwo if this would better be posted elsewhere.

&#x200B;

I find myself facing a lack of motivation and enjoyment of life generally. I have had a lot of stress in the last few years and I think it has created this slow burn, long lasting burnout, and now I feel unsure of how to get out of it. I don't feel a lot, not like the everyday distress or angst I felt many years before, but I do feel a general lack of fulfillment and hope/direction generally. I know what I'm doing and where I'm going, but my emotions are pretty deadened and to an extent that concerns me,

In the last few years:COVID isolation + gaslighting in that time really took a toll for a yearI burned out HARD from a sport (figure skating) that had previously given me a reason to even liveI've moved 5 times, three of those times with lots of family drama and concerns of possible homelessnessHad the usual meeting people, good and bad, and the usual life stress of thatBeen in a relationship that was basically sexually abusiveUncovered latent trauma memories and dived into a medical issue related to it (I have made progress tho! more than i ever thought i could. but I also often dissociate as a result of dealing with this too)Struggled with my relationship to alcohol (I'm doing ok and caught myself early tho!)Taken on a considerable academic load (2 majors and a minor + yearly research prjects + study abroad. I have earned honor rolls and deans list, a research award, and 2 grants tho!) I also work a student job.Dealt with a lot of existential self evaluation and dread as a result (gotten better in the last year tho!)

I still do art, but I struggle to be active. I want to feel like I have more passion again. Something has felt absent, and it's passion. I've become an automated machine driven by my preset determinations. I know the drive is still in me, somewhere- it isn't gone. I would feel absolutely lost otherwise, but I am getting close to that point. I'm starting to question my motivations when I feel emotionally so numb. I noticed that even a lot of my mental processes- thoughts about the world around me and myself and curiosity and intrigue- are starting to go out. The last month or so, I've noticed that passion is absent from my life. It's been years coming. I'm so tired. Things that used to help me get that reinvigoration in drive and motivation, and ideas of the person I wanted to strive towards being, are going away. I feel a bit lost on how to regain these things. I cannot just drop my current work and school load. I also have to do art commissions to make enough money to get by. And I can't unrealize my issues with trauma- I have to at least keep the progress I've made.

How might I manage to regain passion while also feeling I can rest enough to recover and keep up with school and get by? Is it even possible?Sorry if this is a duplicate post, but I didn't find much else that I felt satisfied my question.

Edit: I also usually tend to HAVE to jsutify something logically to do it. I have some more logical reasons to justify my pursuits and to get more active, but sometimes I struggle to find the logical motivation to pursue my passionate activities (like dance, skating again, badminton...). But more so, I have some strong perfectionist tendencies with activity. I just recently redefined my relation to exercise (I thought a standard workout was a "good warmup" and that you should go "fully workout" after that point. And that hitting "point of failure" was getting to where you TRULY can't move anymore- ie: nearly to the point of a damn aneurysm.) Any time I attend dance at my school gym, I am overwhelmed with self hatred and questioning why I even do this.

Post 694: I just need to get this off my chest
Content:
This is probably the wrong place to put this but I really just need to tell someone.

I’m currently in my first year of uni doing a bachelors degree, I’ve never been great a school, especially at maths or calculations. My degree requires me to do biology and chemistry fundamentals. 

We recently had an exam based on the first 3 lab practicals we did, where we have a lab manual we fill out and are able to take into the exams as a resource, and we’re even told that 75% of the exam was already in the lab Prac manual we filled out.

I went into the exam feeling nervous but believing that I had a decent grasp of the content and understanding of the calculations and equations.

I truly believed that I had gotten at least a 60-70% grade mark, we had received our marks back today, I got 30%, I didn’t even get a passing grade.

Finding this out after working my ass off studying and practicing and reviewing and I got 30%, I feel like an idiot for believing I knew what I was doing, this has just destroyed my confidence in myself after trying so hard to build it up since starting uni.

If I failed my first exam that I was confident in (that people keep telling me isn’t worth very much for the final grade) how the hell am I supposed to do any of this.

If I fail this subject I have to re do it next year and pay for it again and honestly, if I fail it, i won’t be retaking it, im just going to drop out all together, because clearly im not smart enough for any of this

Post 695: Job Hunt Stress
Content:
I am feeling incredibly stressed about my future. I recently graduated and am currently unemployed, and finding work online has been a real challenge. I know I'm not alone in this situation, but it's hard not to feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty of it all.

To cope with this stress, I've been trying to break the job hunting process into smaller, more manageable steps. This includes updating my resume, searching for job openings, and networking with others in my field. By focusing on these smaller tasks, I feel like I'm making progress, which helps to reduce my overall stress levels.

I'm also trying to take care of myself both physically and mentally during this time. Eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep are all important for my well-being. I'm also trying out relaxation techniques like deep breathing and meditation to help me calm my mind when I feel particularly anxious.

Despite all of these efforts, there are still times when I feel overwhelmed and stressed out. During those moments, I try to reach out to friends and family for support. Sometimes just talking about my stress with someone who understands can make a big difference.

Ultimately, I know that this is just a temporary setback. I am determined to keep pushing forward and find the job that's right for me. It won't be easy, but I know that with perseverance and a positive attitude, I can make it happen.

If you're feeling stressed about your future, know that you're not alone. Take it one step at a time, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to seek support when you need it. We'll get through this together!

Post 696: Every time I feel stressed out by something, I get sick immediately
Content:
Hi everyone!

Every time I feel stressed out by something, I get sick immediately. Usually its just a cold (or IBS), but this time its pretty bad, I got a viral gastroenteritis, because there  were some work related things in the past few weeks, that were stressing me out A LOT. 

This only happens in winter, but yeah, it happens. 
It's like whenever I feel stressed, my body gives in, decides to go on a strike, to give my mind the rest, it subconsciously craves. However, I can not just dissappear from work, whenever it gets busy. Also for the sake of my finances. 
I had to cancel a couple of work gigs over the weekend due to the current gastroenteritis, but I was really counting on that money.

I don’t know what to do.

I have been in a relationship for the past few months and for the first 3 of the months things have been good. This month as been very stressful between work and school and my mental health have just been deteriorating, and because of that I’ve been more easily irritated. I get into arguments now with my gf everyday about the most mundane things. I am mostly at fault since I’m the one starting them, I’ve just felt like nothing has been enough or certain things she doe’s irritates me. I don’t blame her for anything, she has been the best partner ever and has been very supportive. I just can’t get a hold of my temper and I’m scared it’s gonna drive us apart. I don’t want to be angry I just want to love her and not make her be sad.

Post 701: [Question] Burned out but boss loves my ability and will continue to incentivize if I do more
Content:
TLDR : 3 questions at end regarding how to not care to disappoint when team and boss have seen my abilities. Boss has high aspirations for me this year or which if I fulfill I’m going to stretch myself so thin that I will leave or go into depression.


I was given a rather good yearly review, and well incentivized, but I am currently stressed, and trying to figure out how to have less responsibilities, when it’s desired I have more. This is above and beyond the rest of my team.

Boss sees my “potential” and not only wants it to continue, but also have me lead more, be more of a driver and influencer, and upgrade my knowledge, cross-team visibility. All of which I do not want. Taking on any more work feels like I’m going to “pop” and I’m already near / at burnout.

I hate disappointing and failing (why I try harder than others on my team; and also why I’m hate being in this position I am right now) but I’m at my max currently near / in burnout, thinking or ways to get out. My mindset is that I’d rather quit a 6fig job and go elsewhere / take a break than disappoint and fail someone whom believes in me so wholeheartedly, and knows how fast I can operate.

Sadly I’ve “shown my hand” this past year of what I’m capable of, but it’s unsustainable for my stress levels, needed downtime, and resetting ability. And more is desired. I’ve mentioned already to the boss that I’m burning the candle at both ends, but it’s only been sprinkled throughout the year. I also hate that I would them regret providing a large optional incentivized reward. Additionally if I fail it’s most likely no more of that and I would just be considered “middle of the road”. I’m OK with that if someone didn’t know my abilities, but again I have pushed past 120% capacity many times for tight deadlines and to get things done.

- How do I change my mindset to not care about disappointing 
- What, if anything, do I tell boss? I feel I need to drop hints that this is too much and if I’m dead it does no one good. ( absolutely sucks feeling capable but also having a hapicapied weakness of stress leading to depression.)
- What would you do if you were me with these concerns, and yet burned out?

Post 702: Constant stress about having a career
Content:
Is it so bad that I just wanna be a SAHM. My parents are constantly asking me when I will get an accountant certification or degree, especially since I am 20. My aunts and uncles constantly ask me when I will start working because they say that one person working will be difficult if we try to save up money. Sometimes I feel like my peers look down on me for having a kid at a young age. I’m constantly being told that I have to get some of education, which I am but it’s not something that you can earn quickly. I am already struggling with my grades. Is it so bad that I am chilling at home for a bit and continuing my education at a slower pace. My childhood wasn’t the best and when I left home I had felt a weight come off of me. (I was a second mom for my five siblings) 
My kid does not stress me like the outside world does.

Post 706: Missing a week of college due to illness
Content:
On Friday, I woke up with a fever and was tested for covid and then put in quarantine by Res Life. Luckily, I tested negative for covid but after talking to my doctor it appears I have a bad flu or some kind of viral infection. I live around 4.5 hours away from university and my dad picked me up and drove me home as soon as I had the covid scare so I wouldn't have to quarantine in the Quarantine and Isolation Housing dorm. I'm staying home for the week to recover from whatever I have and to see my doctor in person.   
My professors all let me know what I'd be missing and where I can access work so I don't fall behind. It's so great to see my family again but I'm melancholy because I'm so stressed about missing school and sports practice plus my car and most of my belongings are at my school. The health center, res life, and the dean's office all know the situation but I'm worried that me missing class will come back to bite me when I return to school. College was already extremely stressful for me, especially with my busy sports schedule where I practice 3 nights in a row from 11 pm-12:30 am.   
Is there any advice or coping mechanisms you can give me to help me get over this stress?

I know I am under a lot of stress- we are in FL and school was closed for the hurricane for a few days.  The meeting was on Tuesday afternoon when we had already been told school was closing.

Post 714: Is this a psychological condition? Or just inability to deal with stress?
Content:
Hi, I don't know if it's the right place to post this but lately I have been figuring out the features of a life-long problem of mine. I would call it the simple inability to manage stress but I want to be more specific and Im curious if other people can feel the same based on how I describe it. I would describe the relation between me and stress in this way:

\- The incapacity to accept stress and everyday fatigue as a normal part of life (referred also to very simple tasks)

\- The forced splitting between "bad days" and "good days" where in the bad days Im not allowed to feel good because of some stressful tasks to do that basically ruin the whole day, while in the good days Im not allowed to feel stressed because "Im not supposed to feel so" and Im not meant to do some extra stuff that would cause some fatigue. It also ends up in hating the ending of a "good day" becuase tomorrow is gonna be a "bad day"... You know when sunday is ending and monday is the next day, or also when you're coming back from a vacation, Basically the inability of enjoying the moment because my mind is always projected in the future.

\- Rejection of the idea of facing new stressful situations: this becomes particulary strong whenever I just came through some stressful stuff, my mind sells to me a higher level of stress tolerance/performance in a particular moment, with the promise that Im not going to face new similar situations in the future... I use to motivate myself during difficult moments with the thought that afler that everything is over, Im going to rest and it's gonna be a good time. But this also tricks my mind into thinking that there are not going to be similar stressful situations in the future overall, which obviously can't be true.

\- The high expectation before a supposed "good day" or "good time" is about to come... as if it's going to be a super regenerating moment for me that will restore all my power of will. This is not rational and not realistic most of the times because everyone would never get enough of a "good time" and unpleasant things can happen during a planned good time as well.

\- Feeling envious towards people who are not going through a stressful moment while I am. Focusing almost in an obsessive way on other people around me who are chilled and are not facing anything difficult. In those moments I forget that everyone has stressful moments just not at the same time, I am the free person when other are facing hard moments.

\- the excessive anxiety and discomfort before a task that I know its' going to be stressful... also an easy one. As if my mind was trying to convince me that Im never supposed to be stressed and that's not normal for me doing stuff that I don't like even if they're necessary.

Post 721: Creating the Time You Need to Do the Things You Love
Content:
Time is at a premium these days. It’s hard to find anyone that complains about having too much time on their hands. Most of us are so busy with work, family, and various obligations, there’s little time left to do the things we’d really like to do!

It’s not easy to find time to pursue your passions, but there will be a way.

### Use these techniques to create the time you require for important pursuits: 

**Decide what you want to make room for.** The best way to motivate yourself to create more free time in your life is to identify what you want to make time for! What are the most important things you’d like to spend more time on?

● Figure out how you’d spend that extra time and make sure you have some good reasons. Create a list of reasons that give you an emotional response. Being logical is unlikely to inspire you.  
 

**Use your mornings wisely.** Most people waste their mornings. They stay in bed as long as possible and barely manage to get to work on time each day. Make the most of your mornings. Go to bed earlier and get up earlier.

● It’s often easier to do something worthwhile in the morning than in the evening. What are you missing by going to bed earlier? Probably not a lot.

**Understand the ways you waste time.** We’re quite ingenious at wasting time. Watch yourself for a day and write down all the ways you waste time. When you understand where your time is leaking away, you can start working on solutions.

**Make a schedule.** A schedule can keep you on track and help to ensure that your time is being spent wisely. A schedule can help to minimize the amount of time you waste. You can also build time into your schedule to do the things you enjoy the most.

**Delegate.** Create more time for yourself by utilizing the people around you. This can work at work and at home. There’s a good chance that someone in your life would benefit from being delegated to. Put your employees, coworkers, children, and partner to work! A little help can free up quite a bit of time.

**Prioritize and eliminate.** Perhaps you just have too many non-essential things going on in your life. It might be time to cut back on a few of those obligations.

● Take a look at everything you do each day/week/month and think about how much value those things add to your life. You can probably find something to remove from your life.  
 

You can find time if you have a good enough reason! **Determine what you want to create time for and make it happen.** Delegate, schedule, eliminate, and avoid wasting time. What are you willing to give up to spend time on the things you love?

Post 722: Feeling Overwhelmed?
Content:
It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.   
 

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep.

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list. 

 **Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**

Post 723: stress and high blood pressure
Content:
Since I was a teen I have been dealing with stress due to childhood trauma and I was trying to tell myself that these things were ok. Because of this I have developed high blood pressure from a very young age that is triggered every time I'm angry or stressed.  My pressure readings are "to me" dangerously high at times just this week it hit 165/105/88 and then 159/119/88 30 mins later. I had to go to the Dr and take about 5 tablets to get it down. I'm fairly healthy in terms of weight and diet. I'm a perfect weight and drink a lot of water and juice a lot of fruits and vegetables. I don't smoke and I'm a very casual drinker. My HBP is clearly stressed oriented. 


Just recently my mom decided to vacate me and my siblings because my dad tried to sexually assault my sister and we defended her. For some weird reason my mom took my dad's side. To add to that my girlfriend has not really been faithful in the past and since then things were never the same. I'm battling these things from multiple sides.

I'm a strong believer in God although I must admit I could do a better job in seeking the father. I just don't know what to do. My chest pains are getting stronger and more painful. Every time I go into the Dr they just medicate me and send me home. I have done all the test in the past , Echo, stress test, ECG, I carried home the device they hook up to you for two days and everything always comes back perfect (except for my last ECG which showed small enlargement of my heart. My Thyroid and kidney test is also perfect. I just don't know anymore 😭😩.

I am in such a tight budget and I feel like I cant afford this travel anymore. There are just so so so many hiccups along the way. I am supposed to fly an hour ago but some results for my COVID tests were delayed so I had to miss my flight. And here i am standing at the ticketing counter trying no to freak out because i cant get any refunds and I cant get any flights that can connect properly to my destination. Even my thoughts are jumbled up.

Post 725: Mental breakdown - 2 months of fight or flight won't shut off, has anyone recovered from intense prolonged stress?
Content:
Hello I've been under intense stress for 2 months. For months I've been having headaches. After trying medication I had a panic attack(?) and dissassociate over the weeks where I did some embarrassing things. I then had anxiety and awful health anxiety which lead to insomnia and no sleep. I was already unable to cope but my mum started to shout at me and when she hit me on the head my fight or flight and stress went into overdrive. My brain and emotions are bad, I'm agitated now. All of this led to me feeling suicidal and that activated the stress response more. This all was prolonged over 2 months.

I am now feeling so much regret at not having stopped this all earlier. I am constantly agitated, my fight or flight won't shut off. I can't think or feel properly. I want to be sick all the time. 

CanI recover from this? My head is an absolute mess. I am so tired and scared.

I don’t know sometimes. I wanna maybe try it, but I’m not sure if I would want to. It’s kinda confusing for me, but I’m sorta back and forth. I don’t like seeing like others doing better and idk if it’s hurting me. I’m still in high school and I just care about what others think of me at the moment. I don’t like this mindset, but I don’t know how to get rid of it. My brain just feels confused and weird and mush sometimes and I am super indecisive. I just don’t know.

Post 731: finding beauty in simplicity
Content:
These past few years I feel like I have matured so much mentally (as I'm sure a lot of us have) and I genuinely find beauty in just everyday tasks. I'm prone to feeling alone and sad a lot but have tried to change my thinking about how I view my daily life. I have started keeping a video diary ([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2TxCjH4LQpE56kMR9f5XA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2TxCjH4LQpE56kMR9f5XA)) and it has actually motivated me a lot to get shit done in my life and just be motivated.

Honestly, the reason for this post is just for me to look back on and see if I changed or if i still have the same mindset a year from now. But what are some daily and normal things do you do that u appreciate and are grateful for? One thing I appreciate the most is reading. It really has been a big part of my life and has helped me through alot.

Post 738: Stress.
Content:
It is so common for me. I just can't live without me. Headaches happen all the time, which cause more stress, which cause more painful and longer headaches. I feel no chill, I have lost my interests in almost everything. What I used to love (video games, music) now feel so disstant. And it's all stress. Sometimes I don't even feel it. The school, work oh god. So much of it. And the homework or just work in school is really hard. Also music, I have everyday lessons of clarinet, and the amount of shit I have to learn is just really unbelievable. I set up unachievable goals, get stress from them. I always do things at the last second and get more and more stress. I'am miserable. I watched a reverse psychology video made by CGP Grey about "7 ways to maximize misery", and I think my misery causes the stress. All the points in the video check out. I have no hobbies anymore, I help out other people but never myself. I'am worried, and that causes stress...

Post 741: I've Reached My Limit
Content:
I'm just putting this in here to clear my head, I don't expect anyone to respond or react I need to do this for myself. I'm a 21M transfer student who just returned to college 4 days ago. Before I came back to college, I had settled down at home with my mom through the pandemic with a cozy life of video games, Kwik Trip gas station cooking and cashier work, and relaxing alone at home with a healthy variety of time wasters. 

Fast forward to August 2021 and I was coming up upon heading to university to bring more value to my life as being a career gas station clerk wasn't something I was interested doing. The days following my move away from home are overwhelmingly stressful. Although I still live as boring and comfortable as I had been for that time, I can't shake the feeling that I'm losing everything that I had grown to be comfortable with, but most importantly I was losing the physical support of my mother who's also easily my rock that I can rely on. 

Finally, after days of unrest and stress, I move 3 hours away from home- 2 1/2 hours further away than my previous university. The first night was filled with tears and all I could do to calm myself down was call my mom and talk it out but she's not here and I'm not there. Everything's changed now and there's no going back.

I now live in a leased house about 1 mile from campus with 3 roommates (2 I barely know) with everything that I own packed into my small 16 x 14 room. I have to get my car insurance set up on my own now, I have to join student orgs to make connections as well as gain experience and a social life, the house we have hasn't been renovated since the 80s (previous tenants were also weed smokers who must have been a bit aggressive since there's holes in our wood paneled walls), and I'm not sure if my roommates like me or if I need to give them more space (I'm trying to be more social but I don't know if I may come off as obnoxious to them).

Everything is absolutely insane right now. In a way I love the chaos but I'm exhausted everyday I wake up. I can't rest. Nothing I do makes me feel less stressed. I want to put space between me and my roommates but what if I become a stranger to them? I need time alone but I feel I can't be when the roommates are around otherwise I'm the awkward guy out. I'm running out of energy to converse and make friends with strangers.... Everything has changed.

I just wish I could feel relaxed and like I have a place here.

TLDR: 21M has moved from home in hopes of a more meaningful life. Every facet of life has been changed and constant work has worn him down. Nothing relaxes me now.

I don't know what to do to feel okay.

Post 742: My anti stress plan
Content:
I've been dealing with a life-altering chronic illness for the last 2 years.  Historically, I deal with stress with weight-lifting, cardio, and dance (I used to train 7 to 14 hours a week)  Since I've become sick, I've lost all of my friends, can no longer dance, and can't weight lift.    I know that stress exacerbates my illness, but the illness also causes most of my stress and robs me of my life-long tools for dealing with stress.

I'm directly dealing with stress, but here's my overall plan

* Make better use of a calendar to plan responsibilities.  That way, I can forget about the problem until the reminder shows up.
* Put things in perspective and accept the bad things in life/work instead of worry about them
* Try to laugh and smile
* Take a cold shower when I get home from work.

&#x200B;

Not sure how well this will work, but I am determined to try something so that, while I may be in physical pain every day, I won't be mentally making things worse.  Thoughts?

Post 743: I think this is the first time stress made a negative impact on my health.
Content:
I try to live healthy lifestlyle. I go to the gym 3 times a week, I watch my eating habits. Quit smoking and vaping 1.5 years ago, and I before that I wasnt even smoking for that long. I rarely drink alochol, never drink heavy. 

Despite my efforts, I still constantly feel like shit. I always feel pressure in my head, I feel mild fatigue through out the day. I often forget things, forget to listen to what people are saying to me. Im very sensitive to all kinds of sounds, which make me very irritated. 

Some of more serious issues I had which might be related to stress were stomach ulcer and generaly constant stomach issues, urethritis, all kinds of skin problems, waking up in the middle of night and not being able to fall back to sleep. 

Generaly speaking I dont feel like a healthy person. I dont know what feeling relaxed is like. Sometimes I think whether Im just always anxious and I got so used to it that I consider it normal. Im thinking of trying therapy again.

Post 744: What are my best options out of this burnout?
Content:
Hi guys,

Pretty sure I’ve got burnout and I’d live to know your thoughts on what’s some options to get out of this hole.

I can’t even think straight so planning an exit route from this mess it’s proving hard.

I’ll do a very brief overview of the situation.

Male 39

3 months ago I was training for a ultra  run. I’ve been very active all my life. Energy has never been an issue. 

During the training I started a new job after losing my previous job due to the pandemic. It’s been a massive step outside my comfort zone and I’ve been stressed almost daily for a few month now. 

The problem started after I did the ultra run. The week after I was tired as I expected but then it just kept getting worse and worse to the point I couldn’t even walk up stairs.

Fast forward 3 months. I’ve not been able to do any exercise, my sleep is a mess, I have dry mouth all the time and I’ve got super bad brain fog.

I don’t want to lose this job, it’s a serious career opportunity and could set me up for life and I don’t think it would be that hard if my brain was working properly.

I should Mention that I’ve had my blood tested by the doctor and there was nothing wrong.

I feel like I’m stuck In a cycle where I need to relax but my work is keeping me in a stressed state so I can’t relax and that means that my burnout is never going to go away.

I do have holidays coming up, I’m just praying that my brain is going to reset itself  but the same time I’m seriously worried that if I’m still knackered by the end of holiday which I think could be very possible then I’m going to go back into a busy year of work and I am never going to break out of this cycle.

I’ve been living at home with my parents for the last year because I lost my previous job and I need to move out. I’m ready to buy house but I’m really struggling with the extra pressure of even looking for a house with the way my brain is at the moment.

I know no job is worth giving yourself bad health but I don’t actually think it’s the job, I think that something has gone wrong with my body and the job is not helping but I don’t think necessarily that the job itself is what’s caused this, it’s a combination of maybe overtraining for running combined with the stress of the lockdown and not seeing anyone for year(my parents are isolating), ending of a big relationship I had previous and the work pressure, everything mixed into one somehow has just caused my body to to shut down.

The question, How do I get out of this without losing my job?

I’ve Been thinking maybe I need to go on medication to break the cycle of the stress so I can sleep better not be stressed every day at work and then my body will relax and reset. 

I know Antidepressants might be an option but I feel like they’re just a double edge sword/patch and I’ll just have a bunch of problems later on down the line to deal with coming off them. 

Would love to know Your thoughts on this situation, maybe you’ve been there and found a way back to full energy, thanks for your time

Post 745: I feel something is off with me
Content:
Hello friends! I don't really know where else to go. I don't know whether perhaps one of you kind people may be able to offer some advice for me. 
I've been dealing with, I would say a mild level of stress my whole life. I grew up with parents with high expectations. Recently, my parents split up and the parent I live with took it extremely bad. Screaming and crying, smashing things from time to time, amongst other things. Even after 2 years they are, to some degree, still like this. Only now after 2 years, have I started to feel like I've been transported to a parallel universe. "Surely this isn't my life" is what goes through my head. When the split happened, I don't even remember crying or really reacting. I remember just listening. I feel like the last two years have been a blur. I have this on and off urge to just jump out of my skin and be someone else. Anyone else! It's as if I am panicking because I've woken up in someone else's body and into the wrong life. This is a new feeling for me. I am usually one to spend time with myself and understand how I am feeling,  and acknowledge it, but this is as if I am inside someone else's head. It's like I don't know myself anymore. I start questioning things and giving things the benefit of the doubt. I hate it. I don't want to die, but I just want to switch off. I'm so confused! I have discussed this with my therapist and they did not provide advice. I am happy to provide more info if needed. Thanks in advance.

So I had an interview today for a new job. I've been in my current position for about a year now and while the job itself is okay, the workplace is completely toxic. 
My interview today went GREAT and they want me to start training this week. I told them I have to give my current workplace two weeks notice but am severely stressing over it now. My stress level now is SO much higher than it was before the interview. I agreed to a short orientation at the end of this week, but will have to make something up to tell my job so I can leave early one day.  I already asked to leave early today. I honestly don't know how to handle the way I'm feeling now - I'm happy but so worried over how they're going to react and just know they won't be understanding at all. 
I can't sit still or focus or relax. I didn't get expect it to go well and was going to chalk it up to another practice run interview.

I just joined this subreddit and haven't looked into coping mechanisms yet, but anyone who has tips on how to handle stress, please share. I just need to get these stressors off my chest. 

1) Had a baby 3 months ago. That shits hard.
2) Toilet fucking exploded and our roof leaked, pretty much destroying our house. 
2 a) My house has been in shambles for 2 months 
2 b) they've finally started working on my house, which means me, the baby and the dog have to be out from 7am to 7pm. 
2 c) being out of the house means being with my parents, my sister, my baby, 3 dogs and a bird in 1 house
2 d) even with 20k from insurance, were paying 50-60k in repairs
2 e) dog is reactive and is stressed/struggling with being out of our home 
3) fucking pandemic. Province just shit down again, can't see my friends or extended family. 
4) Grandma passed away in October because of cancer. Other grandma is dying of cancer. My husband's grandma also has terminal cancer.
5) to top it off, I found out today my care wheel needs to be replaced. Not the biggest deal, just the icing on the cake.

This stress has cause myself and my husband to feel overhwelmed and depressed, which has taken a serious toll on our relationship. I feel like in a few months things may be better, but I'm just in over my head right now.

I'm super worried about it because I don't know what's causing it, and thanks to lockdown, I can't get a GP apt right now - but apparently RMD can be from stress?

So I’ve been breaking out in hives for like 2 weeks now, thought they were big bites at first because I haven’t changed anything to make my skin break out... then they spread and spread, all over my back and hands. I took Benadryl for a couple days and slept for the 16 hours a day I wasn’t at work. I don’t understand why I’m breaking out? I don’t even feel that stressed, really... I mean I have stressful stuff going on (healthcare worker, death in the family, and SO deploying) but I’m not *feeling* particularly stressed about those? I guess my body is more stressed than my brain? Or my brain has been so stressed it’s numb from it now? I don’t know what to do, I can’t sleep for 16/24 hours. I don’t understand. Has anyone else experienced this?

I work out, I drink a gallon of water a day, I eat healthier than I have my entire life...

Post 763: College Stress
Content:
Hey! I'll try to make this as simple as possible. I'm a predental student in my first year of college. Currently living at home due to corona. Last semester quite literally destroyed me. Calc and chem at the same time sucked (mainly just calc in general), but I ended up with an A in calc and an A- in chem. But getting those grades also made me lose about 12 pounds (I was only 130 to begin with), I lost so much hair from not eating, I got dumped my by boyfriend since I "stress out too much", and I upset a lot of people close to me since I spent so much time complaining about things that in reality aren't even that bad. I should be grateful I even have the privilege to go to school, yet I spend most of my time crying about "having" to do it.

I told myself I would do better this semester. Up until yesterday I have. I haven't thrown up before any tests like I used to. But I just got out of a midterm that I do not think I did too well on, and the spiral of worst case scenarios starts. A lot of it is due to the pressure of dental school, but a lot is also due to making my dad proud. He's done nothing to pressure me into doing well, but he's given me so much in regards to life and paying for college I feel so guilty if I don't get all As.

My problem is mainly my mindset. I'm not ready to have the same semester I had last time, and I'm scared of who I'll upset for being like this. I thought I was better, but every time I have a midterm (usually math based) I break. I'm not going to get into dental school like this.

Since October (for the last 4 months) I have had the following symptoms 24/7 - I wake up with them and go to sleep with them and nothing changes how they feel. Constant head pressure back top of the head. Constant pressure behind the eyes. Constant brain fog. Constant blurred vision and sometimes lightheadedness. Inside my head feels like it’s vibrating and It feels I’m going over waves visually. Overall I have a feeling that I am not fully present. I feel tired and just in a fog. Doctors really have had no clue what this is. I recently started a medication for stress and anxiety but that hasn’t changed anything in a few weeks. Any ideas?

Post 769: Mothers voice rings in my head
Content:
To anyone who had parents who never let them use their money on unimportant things do you struggle with getting yourself a gift because you hear your parents lecturing you about how you could've used that money on something important even when it's a gift card? I have an Amazon gift card, it's only 25.00. I should use it for something I would like but I'm having such a hard time because every thing I look at I'm being reminded of all the time I was excited to buy something fun and got immidiatly told to either use it all on clothes or to give it to her for gas. It doesn't happen all the time but right now it's bugging me how I'm kind of afraid to spend 25 dollars and I can't even think of anything I need right now

Post 770: Everything is falling apart
Content:
My life is falling apart. I got laid off last month ago, my father is going to be unemployed in the coming 2 weeks. My parents are abusive as hell and make life unbearable. My younger siblings have eating disorders and one of them might off herself or die from the damage her body has sustained. I am not able to save anyone or myself. It is like everything that can go wrong is happening.

Post 771: I'm stressed about work
Content:
I've been with my company since i started working at 18. Its all i know and recently its becoming more and more apparent that i cannot handle either the level of work I'm putting on myself or the level of work that is imposed on me.

I don't know anything else other than what I've been doing here and i don't know where to start should i leave.

Sometimes I think that it's all in my head and I can push harder to improve. It feels like I'm against a wall that i can only just put my finger tips on top of.

I wish i could stop it all and breath, but i can't. The situation I have prevents me from not doing anything. I need to be working to live the way i am.

I'm scared and I'm not, I'm worried and im not. I live in some kind of emotional purgatory where i can't feel more than a hint of happiness or sadness some days and others i feel normal. i want to live in a better state than I'm currently living. I'm not happy but i don't let myself feel sad.

Post 772: Job stress
Content:
I've worked at a tier 2 automotive manufacturing plant for almost 11 years.  Over the years I've had more and more piled on my plate.  It got to where I'm having anxiety attacks regularly at work and at home.  After staying at a high level of stress for so long, I feel like I can't think straight anymore. My memory is terrible now, I can't stay focused, I feel frozen in panic most of the time.  I literally feel mentally damaged. I've felt like I have nothing left for my child or husband when I get home because I'm mentally drained.  Last week I decided I can't live like this anymore and I resigned!  I'm tired of spending my life feeling dead inside! I did agree to work from home part time for a few weeks to train a replacement.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do next but I feel like I'm heading in the right direction.

Post 773: How do you get over overthinking???
Content:
Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve always overthought. If I make a mistake, I’ll think about it for days, which turn into weeks, and sometimes months. For example, about a week and a half ago I picked up my friend and her cousin and went to the mall and I accidentally took the exit incorrectly (there was traffic cones and shit), and I still think about because I’m so embarrassed. The moment keeps replaying in my head and I keep coming up with solutions to the situation. Like, what if I killed us 3? What if I hurt other people exiting? What if everyone’s scared of driving with me again? What if I hit someone, or someone hit me? What if there wasn’t any road right there? What could’ve happened because of my stupidity? Like Im just so fucking annoying and stupid and dumb. I hate me bro. 

I’ll think about things that happened years ago and it’ll be on my mind for the longest time until I just simply forget. 

Sometimes when I get the thinking and get annoyed in a way, and I slap my head. As if I can slap the thought out of me. It stresses me out so bad. Sometimes I just wish I could just die so I won’t have to think at all. My thoughts eat away at me. 

My friend kept yelling at me last night, and the more she did, the more sadder I got and kept overthinking that I was an annoying pest and they didn’t want me around. I kept calling people to say Happy Halloween and both my friends kept yelling. And I know they meant it innocently, but now I just can’t/won’t stop thinking about it. I just know it. 

I just don’t know how to stop thinking. And I need help. How do I stop overthinking? What can I do?

Post 774: Just Failed Nursing Course

I was in my second to last semester of nursing school and I failed the course. Now I have to wait until spring to try again and hopefully complete my degree. Has anyone else experienced failure like this but somehow managed to pick themselves up again?

Post 775: Overworked over stressed overwhelmed
Content:
So I just have these random moments of anxiety and fast heartbeat at times. I think the majority of the time it’s my job that causes me to feel stressed. I try to always keep in mind that I can only do so much but having this mindset doesn’t always keep me from feeling this way. It’s pretty stressful job and now having been there a few months I can see why people come and go. Also living with a toxic parent hearing him call my siblings horrible names and constantly arguing with my mother for the dumbest reasons. It’s all too much and I just really wanna find a way out. Just writing this is causing me to be emotional. I just want  to be stress free. There’s just no way that this is life, I refuse to believe it ....

Post 776: You can stop your stress by recognizing that the simple feeling of it is you putting your attention in a specific part of your physical body. (In this case your stomach).
Content:

By realizing that you can guide your attention somewhere else in your body allows you to unblock that Stuck energy which then lets you feel your whole individual spirit inside of your body. 

Gifting you with the direct contact of your true energetic self, who resides under your skin. 
Think of how it's easy to feel "inner things" under your skin like stress, it's just as easy to clear and then activate an accumulation of your positive emotions.(Thanks to you controlling your thinking and attention).

Here's my [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/vjV75hRXxDY) about how to take back control of your true energetic self and not let it be reduced to bad emotions.

Post 777: This class
Content:
The class I am taking is taking everything out of me. I am only 18 but I've taken college classes before. This is NOT my first semester. I know how to study. I know what kind of learner I am. This isn't my first rodeo. This class is 10 credit hours and mandatory as part of my degree/program. The 10 credit hours doesn't scare me either. Two of the classes I've already taken have been 10 credit hours. 

But this class, It takes everything out of me. My instructor is the world's greatest dick, totally uncaring, inflexible, and rambles about nonsense all the time. He is a stereo typical manly man and very self centered and egotistical. Surprisingly so considering the feild that this class is for.He says there are no dumb questions but will often make you feel bad and really dumb for asking a question. On the rare instance he doesn't gaslight you, he rambles and doesn't really answer the question and leaves you more confused then you were in the start. Very, very, verrrryyyy rarely has he ever answered a question properly. He expects you to already be an expert in an entry level class. The fact that we are living through covid and do most of our classes online doesn't help either. I am not an online learner. I've spoken with other people in the class and it is mutual that everyone is struggling and they all hate the man.

I've spoken to many professionals in the field. They all agree and empathize with me. I even had one person told me that my instructor "doesn't know what the hell he's doing when it comes to teaching". 

I Know part of the blame lies on me. But I went from a straight A student to getting Cs on all my tests. Cs get degrees but in my class i need a B or higher to pass. Everytime I log on to lecture or go to class I end up crying at some point. I cry atleast 4 times a week. 

I cant drop the class because my family paid for it and are really proud of me. I cant waste their money. We dont have the money to waste. I feel terrible. My parents never went to school so they don't understand how hard it is either. I feel so alone. 

I have no time to do anything but homework and go to work. I have no outlet and am not allotted one. I can't see my friends, my girlfriend, my family. Anyone out side of my coworkers, customers, my parents, and my instructor. Even if I had the time Covid does not allow it.

I just got home from class and I am getting a massive migrain (comeing back from the one last night). I went to take my migraine medications and in doing so the water bottle sprayed all over me prompting me to go into my room and ball my eyes out.

I have no doubt this class will prepare me for my career. But it will do so in the way that getting stabbed in the face prepares you for a punch in the gut. 

I can not leave this situation. I have to finish out this class. I have no choice but to take this class. I have no idea what to or how to handle all this stress. I am open to all suggestions; study tips, time management,  stress management, anything.

I have a 500 word essay due by midnight tonight. 

Wish me luck, guys.

((Edited for clarity and a bit of grammar))

Post 778: I want to relieve all my stress because i dont have anyone to talk to
Content:
So i'm(21) staying in my work due to pandemic, we're not allowed to go home because our company is afraid if we get Covid-19. Our house is very near in my office, it's like 15 or 20 minutes drive. I miss my boyfriend, pets and my family. I feel that i have a lot of responsibility in this age, like we're building my boyfriend's house because he said that will be our house in the future but before i gave the money we talk that we will  build that as apartment so we will get money from that, i also have responsibility that we will build my parent's house (in the future my brother's house). 

And I always made mistake in my work by the way i'm online casino dealer. So, that is one of my stress.

We're also not allowed to go outside,to order delivery food, to visit each other's room or to have visitor. I tried to talk to my boyfriend some of my problem,but all he said is i'm negative person. So i don't want to talk to him my another problem. I dont know if i have depression or anxiety but i feel that my heart will explode if i dont have anyone to talk. Now i'm crying and scream that why this happen to me.

Post 781: None of my anti stress techniques are usable anymore
Content:
Almost all of them can’t be used anymore. I’ve been diagnosed with jme (epilepsy) so baths and candles are banned. The weathers crappy so I can’t leave to make the hour long trek to the nearest town and it feels like my helicopter parents are breathing down my neck. I’m also kinda trapped in my room since the two of them tend to patrol the main floor of the house (I’m on the second). My room is not very soundproof and my brothers in the basement so I’m stuck here

My new meds are also showing some side effects
- nausea
- balance issues
- sensory overload
- headache (close to migraine)
- restlessness 

Things I’ve tried and have failed 
- cold cloth over eyes
- sleeping
- eating 
- keeping busy
- essential oils
- calm music
- painting
- tai chi (light exercise)

Doesn’t help that my mom is slamming stuff downstairs 
Is there any other things I can do? I really don’t wanna do nothing and let this escalate

Post 787: Please Help Me!
Content:
Why am I always sweating? I have pink stretch marks on my back, down both my right and left bicep, and the left and right side of my stomach. Visually, I look terrible. My face looks super dry and blemished, my hair is dry/thin and keeps falling out. My beard hair isn't growing...both brothers had full beards at 18, I'm almost 20. Every now and then I have concentration issues, memory problems, speech problems, no motivation. What's going on? I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism not too long ago and started taking 25mcg of levothyroxine. The medication worked the first three days...now I'm back where I started  What's the problem? I do have poor eating habits. I'll usually eat enough calories before finishing the day, but eat at random times throughout the day. Usually I'll wait until I start sweating and can't think clearly to start eating. Do I need to break that habit to heal my thyroid? How often should I eat? I'll wait too long and become super stressed. My muscles also feel heavy/fatigued and tend to ache a lot. If someone can help navigate me to an answer, that would be greatly appreciated...thank you!

Post 788: Trauma Fueled Anxiety
Content:
So many posts I am seeing are from women who are heartbroken over how they are being treated, but are still so attached to their toxic partner. As a trauma therapist with a PhD in this stuff, this is known as the trauma bond. And it comes from an unfulfilled need you have been carrying around for a long long time. And you are trying to heal by unconsciously accepting relationships that keep replicating the same trauma bond over and over again, hoping this time you can fix it. 

But here is the lightbulb moment. 

It's not about fixing THEM. That is their healing journey. You got to figure out what it is in YOU that feels so lost, broken, incomplete... and heal that first. You have to rebuild your internal foundations, work on creating new goals for yourself, work on learning about wellbeing and personal happiness. 

There are lots of resources out there on this. Let me know if I can answer anything. You all are more powerful than you even know!

Post 791: am I suffering from stress or anxiety?
Content:
hello let me start off by saying I am a fairly healthy individual, I'm 18 years old M not overweight and I have no unhealthy habits such as smoking or drinking. I'm not sure if I'm suffering from stress or if I have a condition. randomly throughout the day I get chest aches, arm aches, leg aches, and sometimes headaches. I will sometimes feel a little fatigue and dizziness. I overthink scary stuff like if I'm going to die because all these symptoms make me feel like I'm having heart problems or something serious, I get nervous and sweaty when I think about it. when I feel the left side of my chest (nipple area) it's really sore and painful, same with my left side. sometimes my heart will randomly hurt or at least I think it's my heart. I have like this almost burning sensation on my esophagus or upper chest it doesnt really hurt it's just uncomfortable, like when you eat a crap ton of really cold ice cream. I searched online and apparantly I'm suffering from stress because I have almost all the symptoms. I've been having anxiety for months now so I think I am indeed suffering from stress not too sure tho. I realize when I wake up in the morning, everything is gone, all the pain and anxiety and I feel normal. as the day goes by it gets worse and at night it's at its worst. I just need to know if I should get a checkup for maybe some condition or is it just stress

Post 792: Experiences with Stress Migraines

About a month ago I made a post on this subreddit about how I learned to overcome my stress migraines. After reading the comments, I realized that people have very different experiences with migraines. What have your experiences been like? I'm curious to hear the different stories people have.

Post 793: Severe stress, I literally feel crippled, cannot stop throwing up
Content:
I am a 34 year old female. I have had quite a year to say the least, amidst all the other nonsense going on (covid, riots). I am also in the middle, hopefully near the end, of a messy divorce with an extremely resentful ex (no kids, thankfully). Due to me moving out on my own, I started to have some financial issues, then it just seemed to snowball. I got into a fender bender in my brand new car, have to pay a $500 deductible, and unfortunately still pay my car payment (I was honestly hoping it would have been totaled and got me out from underneath the loan). Then I started to get a sinus infection and they made me test for COVID (which was negative, but I had to take a week off work anyway). I just can't seem to get it together and I literally feel like I'm killing myself with all this stress and nonsense. I feel uncomfortable in my own skin all the time. I get very disoriented and "dumb", feel like I'm in a dream, debilitating anxiety, muscle twitches (specifically my right eye), shaking, exhaustion, can't get my thoughts straight ever (I seriously cannot remember if something actually happened lately, or if I dreamed it) ,and lately, just throwing up constantly. Going to work is a nightmare (I'm an insurance broker - and have been for 4 years), but I've missed a lot of work this year and all of my co-workers pretty much hate me. The thought of sitting chained to my desk all day makes me crazy, but I know I need to go because I need money. It's a non-stop shit show. The only thing that seems to help is alcohol, which ***trust me*** I know, does NOT help. I can't live like this anymore. I know there's a happy, fun girl in there, but I'm so lost. 

Currently, I'm on 100mg of Zoloft which seems to be doing nothing. I was taking Mirtazapine briefly, which is great for sleep, but not so great if you're trying to watch your figure. What are some things you guys do to manage your stress? I literally feel like I'm losing my mind.

Post 794: Chronic stress recovery stories?
Content:
I have undergone 3 years of chronic stress and I finally have been able to change my lifestyle and remove the stressors in my life. It was so bad that my hair was falling out, I wasn't sleeping, I lost 20lbs, and my mental health deteriorated. With the doctors help I have addressed my health issues but I still feel tense and on edge sometimes. I developed fears of situations that were the hardest for me but I don't let it prevent me from living. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has been in this situation and what did you do during recovery? Also, how long were you under this amount of stress and how long did it take to recover?

Post 796: I can barely handle schoolwork
Content:
It’s not even that much, but I’m incapable of remote learning. I need things explained to me. And I can’t ask my teachers questions because I don’t even know what I don’t understand. We’re not even being graded for accuracy anymore but every time I try to do an assignment I panic and break down because I just can’t deal with this.

Post 797: Stressed out of my mind and trying to hide it
Content:

So I’m 15 and recently my family bought our first apartment (we used to just rent). It was already stressful at the beginning looking for an affordable yet good place cuz my dad was worried about not being able to pay rent for any longer due to Covid and my parents not being able to work. So fast forward we move to the new place and hand over our old apartment. I don’t really want to go into the details, but long story short my dad is planning on suing the seller of the new apartment for misleading stuff. Meanwhile at our old place, there’s a possibility of them suing us. And now, I’m just fucking scared tbh. I’ve never had the word “sue” applied in my life before and it’s still taking me time to process the situations. We’re in a fucked situation and me being 15 and not knowing a lot regarding this, I’m really scared and worried for my family. My dad and my brother are managing all of this, so I don’t want to burden them even more with my emotions. I got the news of all the suing 2 days ago, and since then, I’ve been having panic attacks (rarely happens for me, I don’t have any mental health conditions) and hiding up in my bunk bed to cry. We’re also just an average family so I’m really scared about how all of this could affect our financial situation, and what would happen if we lose. I’m also really worried about my dad. Since Covid started, it has affected my parents’ business a lot so he had to take car of that, along with finding a new home and then the moving process. Now all the suing and he can’t even catch a break. My mind is just running with a lot of fear and anxiety from the moment I wake up to me tossing and turning in bed at night, which I’m having trouble containing. I think I’m even having those hypertension thingys cuz my head hurts all the time. And whenever I’m on my phone and I read smt related to law or legal stuff, I just feel like crying. On top of all this, I’m trying to do my homework but sitting at my desk, this just resonates at the back my mind. I know writing this on here is pointless cuz no one can do anything, but just letting it out to strangers has helped a little bit. Im still pretending to act normal towards my friends and family but my soul feels lost. I’m also not in the mindset of “why is this happening to my family” but moreso “how the fuck are we gonna get through this”. I’m just...really scared.

Post 798: Can stress/anxiety cause a low-grade fever?
Content:
Here’s the story:
Since September of 2019 my stress/anxiety levels have been off the scale. I was in a car/motorcycle accident with my family & boyfriend. We were all in the truck and physically fine. However there were two people riding the motorcycle that rear ended us. One passed on scene and the other has very very slowly recovered after many surgeries. I dropped down to part time in school, took leave from my serving job and quit my second job during the fall semester and had gone back full time for spring. Id been blessed to had never seen any kind of accident like we did that night. 
Now, 7 months later I find myself stressing over my normal things. Money, health, family, bills, school, the sound of a motorcycle, however it’s on a totally different scale. I started taking my temp when I feel myself get that shaky, stomach turning stress/anxiety. I’m finding that my temp ends up at 99.6-99.9 when I usually sit at 97.8. I know that doesn’t sound like much but I’m wondering why this is. 
I plan to soon get professional help after our current pandemic settles. 
Thank you in advance for advice and explanations!

Post 799: I'm failing all my classes and my school wants to do a meeting with my parents.

My grades have been A's and B's my entire life basically, until this year. All my grades are currently below 40%. My parents have high expectations and they think I'm passing all my classes. My school called them and asked if they could do a Zoom call with me this Thursday. Because of this quarentine I haven't found any motivation to do any assignments since it started.

Post 800: Tips to avoid stressors?
Content:
So I’ve narrowed down my stressors to a 2 that seem to burn me out.


1. I feel I have to hide when I’m procrastinating at my office job in between tasks. I feel I have to be aware of my surrounding for nobody to notice I’m not working, but reading news and looking at reddit.
If I feel that my colleagues and boss are in a good mood, I don’t have this feeling. Noise really stresses me out, and being in an open office with 10 people where people are talking often, I can’t even focus on my job.


2. When I have things that I want to do outside of work I get stressed trying to do them because of my girlfriend. I fear that she will turn angry about what I’m doing, so I hurry doing laundry, cleaning, cooking, playing games etc. She sometimes demands my full attention, because I do become quite unavailable doing my “tasks”.
If I do communicate with her about what I’m doing and want to, I usually don’t get this feeling.

Any tips to overcome these situations?

My biggest hurdles is that I assume a lot and that I’m shit at communicating my needs and wants.

Post 801: Finally told my boss
Content:
So it finally happened got to a point at work that I can’t cope anymore after all the support I was promised months ago that never appeared. Call my boss round to my control room and broke down told him I can’t do this anymore I’m continually getting more and more worked up and I can’t cope anymore I can’t keep doing everything that is piled on me and do my job well. Explained I’ve been walking up at night and stressing at home over work. 

Thankfully he has understood and I’ve taken a break using the mental health days we get see how I go in a week.

Post 803: Any tips on how to not let stress overwhelm you in the moment?
Content:
So I just started graduate school this semester, which of course is adding on to the stress I already feel daily with money concerns, driving, interacting with people... lol you know, the usual problems of a highly tense person. 

I've been noticing more lately that I'm doing a poor job at controlling my stress. Once something goes wrong, no matter how minor the inconvenience, my brain freaks out. It's like the world is going to end if I don't find a parking spot or if I sleep in past my alarm. 

I've been taking my stressed induced panic/anger out on my wife and I feel horrible about it. I do what I can to make space and get myself away, but it doesn't seem to help. Definitely thinking about going to therapy or something similar to make sure I don't ruin a relationship due to my mental health. Does anyone else have similar problems? Are there any good things to try out to calm myself down when I get too overwhelmed?

Post 804: Stress Rashes?
Content:
For many months I had rashes all over my body and I went to several doctors and no one could figure out what they were, and no medications would help. These rashes made me miserable and I think may have been caused by stress. I went a whole month without them and now they are coming back. Does anyone have any ideas on how to avoid them/get rid of them? I am so lost and the itching is driving me crazy.

Post 805: Need to Vent
Content:
I just need to vent. I’m sitting in the bath right now crying more than I have in a long time because I’m finally letting it all out. My Mom and Dad have always been people with their heads on straight but are now addicted to gambling. (It used to be just my Mom, using it as a filler of the void of losing her brother and mom so close together, but now my Dad goes as well) I just got a cat and it wouldn’t be an issue but since my Mom and Dad have gone out every night this week their schnauzer either comes in my room and terrorizes my cat around the clock or I lock her out of my room and she scratches and howls all night, leaving me with no sleep either way. I am too stressed to come home & too stressed to leave because I feel like I am abandoning my family. My mom has bad spine problems and has to spend most of the day on ice. This has led her to starting medical marijuana and isolating herself. She is also very christian, as well am I, but she constantly complains & sulks in her sorrow wondering why God won’t heal her and heals other people, but continues to do things that are bad for her health, like spend all hours of the night (I’m talking 10pm-6am) in the casino, and sleeping until 1pm everyday. My Dad is older (70s) and I am so afraid of moving/feel guilty not spending a lot of my time with him because I am afraid of him dying as he had prostate cancer a couple of years ago (it’s completely gone now, but still the fear is there.) I literally can’t take this emotional shit on top of school, work, my own emotional shit (anxiety, depression, OCD, still in pain over a bad breakup/loss of my best friend who I confided everything in a year ago) and trying to make something of my life. I want to succeed in music and acting and other things and I feel like I am just trapped. Guys I literally am just at my wits end right now. I just needed to vent. 21/F. Say a prayer or send good vibes or whatever you do, please. Thanks in advance.

Post 809: Work stress
Content:
Hello there.

So I just graduated from High School, and got my first full time job. I started working at a liquor store about a month ago. It's fun, well-paying and I'm meeting tons of new people. But come Christmas Season, the work-load is increasing, there is a lot more stock, the excess stock is overflowing, our manager recently got let go and we're having time managing. I'm having a really difficult time coping at the moment. I was always against it; but I've taken up smoking to try calm me down, I sleep like a log but wake up tired, and I just feel trapped! I'm currently on my third day in a row of a full day at the shop and I don't have any time off until Christmas day, then I,m on for another 5 days in a row. I'm missing my family, and feel completely stressed. 

Has anyone else experienced this, and can suggest any strategies of decreasing stress levels?

Any reply is appreciated.

Post 810: A lot of things going wrong. Pain. The pain.
Content:
I'm 24, male. I've ruled out costochondritis, now thinking it's GERD. Tickle in the throat, sore chest, pain by armpits. Back pain. Trying to stay calm knowing it isn't my heart. But shit, everything is sore. I get this chest pain, then a sharp tickle in my throat and ear. Hot right heel (yes, by my foot). Sore shoulders. The chest pain is under my breastbone towards my sternum - which I know is usually costo, but I don't know. Doctors haven't diagnosed it. But I do get acid reflux and heartburn. I smoke, but it hurts. The pain always comes when my chest is sore. Is this anxiety making everything worse? Stressed as hell. I was never like this four months ago. Everything is so sudden. 

Please help.

Post 811: We are building a tool to help people with their stress and would love your feedback!
Content:
We are building a SaaS platform for individual users to measure, track and predict mental well-being (think Fitbit for your mind!). We are currently operating as a Slack bot integration (we believe this have the lowest barrier for users). Our slack bot, Anna, asks a couple questions every other day throughout the week (Monday to Friday) and displays your **trends over time**. **Only you** will ever see this information. We have also created a **journaling feature and provide a number of recommendations tailored to your well-being level**! 

We have recently built out our management interface! Individuals within organizations will have the **option** of sharing their totally anonymized data to be aggregated into an organizational-level overview of how an entire company or department is feeling. It is **all opt-in,** i.e. employees must feel comfortable enough opt-in before management receives the overview. Management will receive **visualizations of their company well-being, analysis over time, anonymized feedback from employees, and recommendations on how to improve!** The idea is to demonstrate just how significant an issue poor workplace mental health is for organizations and help them improve it!

To try out the **individual experience FREE**: 

1. If you want to try out our bot join our beta workspace, [**AnimoBeta**](https://join.slack.com/t/animobeta/shared_invite/enQtNzk2MjI3OTM0MjkyLWI0NjJkNTI2OTI0MmRkNjZkN2EzNmI4NDU1MmRiMDIzYzNiNWYxZWIwZmU3MDY5N2QzZTE3YmI1Mzc0NjNjNzA) *(This is to keep things separate from your company Slack)*

Post 814: Stress vent/ low key plea for help and advice
Content:



I have no Job at the moment. Over the summer, I started a landscaping company with my partner and things were starting off top notch. When the summer ended, I was starting school after dropping out after 2 years. I dropped out because I had a huge falling out with an extremely close friend of mine. I don’t want to put too much details on what that falling out was, but basically I destroyed his trust in me and not only that I lost literally every friend I had. Me and him where so close together that when shit hit the fan, the other people in our circle stopped talking to me. It took me 2 years to recoup my social loss and all the depression I had. I had tried to commit suicide but failed after saying goodbye to my friends over the phone. They called the police and they came out to speak with me. During this time I also started to delete all my social media. I deleted my twitter account, instagram, and partially my Facebook. I took down all my photos of my face and Unfriended all my close friends (except family because My only means of communication are thru Facebook) Finally during that summer I started feeling like myself again. As if, things could turn for the better instead of the worse. 

I chose to go back to school to try and put myself back on a good track in life. When I was in school before the events above, I was planning on joining the US Army as a Second Lieutenant. It’s been a dream and passion of mine since I was born. My parents have pictures of me all over the house in army costumes and huge cardboard boxes that I drew on to look like tanks. I felt alive being in that uniform. Especially in college as I joined the university’s ROTC program. Unfortunately as I grew older, my parents health became poorer and poorer. My father has crushed discs in his spine as well as diabetes and early onset dementia. It’s mostly he will forget directions to the store and what he did yesterday or 3 hours ago. But apparently he will soon forget our names. My mom has MS and fibromyalgia on top of PTSD from some trauma she experienced thru her childhood. As well as had extensive surgeries in the past. Both take extremely potent pain killers. My dad is the worst with it. He literally snorts them like coke and does atleast 5-7 a day. My mom has to control how much he takes but there pain is so severe most days there’s no other remedy I can really show them. I tried talking them into medical weed but my parents aren’t interested in the properties and say they won’t work. From there medical history you can tell they don’t have any income except for my oldest brother who is a high functioning autistic adult currently on his Masters Program at the same school I was attending. So financial issues has always been a problem for our family. We don’t have any other family with us. Both my moms side and my dads side hate us for some reason so it’s really just me that they depend on. I have another older brother, but he moved out and hasn’t spoken to any of us in awhile. He calls during the holidays but that’s really the only contact we have. My parents are always...ALWAYS behind the ball on bills and we have had multiple disconnections from the electric company. One time, they didn’t pay for 3 months straight and the bill totaled 866$ on top of reconnection fees. So I had to figure out how to pay all of it because my parents had no earthly idea how to come up with the money. Every month for the past 3 years has been a challenge for money. I’ve worked jobs, stolen things, sold drugs just to keep us up but it’s just never enough. 2 years ago they had a house they where buying and had went behind on the mortgage for almost 6 months. I had no idea because they never told me about it. They lost the house and had to move into a rental. And who took care of that? I did. I’ve been having to care for my sick parents since I graduated high school. I had to put my dreams aside because I couldn’t just leave for the military. They couldn’t even last the couple of months I would be gone for training. So I put my dreams away to try and hustle and work to bring them out. I started looking into ways of making as much money as I possibly can but EVERYTIME I make a breakthrough, something happens like my car breaking down. Or something doesn’t get covered by insurance. And since I stole, it had come back to haunt me which of course I expected. Thankfully I never had to go to court or anything so I’m having to pay a restitution which is too much a month for me to pay and yes I have been missing those payments. I understand the repercussions of those actions but I have to focus my energy on maintaining my apartment which I rent ontop of my parents house which I help pay a portion for as well as the electric and internet. As well as dog food for the dogs, the gas for me and my dads car. A portion of my oldest brothers books, as well as other things here and there to keep them afloat and alive. I am drowning in debt.

I went back to school to try and get a business degree this semester. But the age old need for assistance from me came back to haunt me and instead of investing my financial aid from college on some business ideas  I had to try and make it ended up going to there bills and mine. When I realized I spent all my grant and scholarship money on bills and not my textbooks and school stuff I just withdrew. No point in going to class unprepared. Also since it’s the fall we have had no business for landscaping so we’ve been short on jobs. I’ve been trying to apply for seasonal work and other jobs but so far it’s been more of a bust than anything good. Now I’m 1 week late on rent for my apartment. I have to come up with close to 1000$ in less than 3 days to pay my rent, my bills and my parents rent and bills. So I’m basically beyond fucked. I could kill myself, but it’s not gonna solve the problem. I just don’t know what to do. And tbh I just wish I can be someone else right now. Like delete this saved game and start new lol. 

That’s my rant for the day. I don’t expect anyone to respond to this so if you read this and commented. Thanks for listening.

How do you all deal with work stress. I have pretty thick skin with quite the backbone. But after 2 years at a bullshit job that mistreats their employees but makes it worth it with the money (seems manipulative if you ask me). But today they finally have me in the bathroom quietly crying to myself. I don’t feel like I can take it anymore. But they money is so great. Does anyone have advice? Throw it at me. I’m open to the whole spectrum of advice haha

Post 816: Why I hate watching scary movies.
Content:
I watched the movie Midsomer and I have not been able to get it out of my head. 

I hate watching scary movies but in the past I would get over them in about a day or so because the things in them were fake. Things like ware wolves, ghosts, vampires, immortal men running around killing people and other things that don’t exist. 

But Midsomer...? It’s a story that’s plausible. If you don’t know what it is, it’s about a cult. And it’s fucked up. That movie, I have not been able to get over and it’s been 4 days. It’s giving me anxiety. I keep thinking morbid things will happen to me or the people around me. I havnt been able to sleep with my door open or the lights off, my boyfriend has had to stay the night every night because otherwise I can’t sleep. I’m 23 years old and I work in an ER where I see actual injuries and people actually die and that doesn’t keep me up at night. But that movie has screwed with my head. 

I hate watching scary movies and I only watch them with my family once a year, which is around Halloween. My family states that my “immunity” does not exist in the month of October. 

I know this is page is about stress but that movie has given me so much anxiety that I feel stressed. I havnt drank soda in four days because my heart feels like it’s racing all the time and I know caffeine and sugar will only make it worse. 

Not sure what to do to get over this. I’ve never been affected by a movie this way before.

My one sister said she was (I think because of her job and relationship issues) and is now on antidepressants. 

My other sister has been on them and has just received 3 long texts from her kid (who she hasn’t seen in about a year) about how they (how they identify not more than one person) hate her. I’m not gonna go into exactly what was said but it was brutal. I love both my sister and her kid so I’ve always tried to be in the middle, but I couldn’t even believe what was said and out of nowhere too. 

Now I’m gonna have to keep an eye on both of them. I’m the youngest and have my own problems but I can’t just ignore it. Urgh. 

I hate this. It’s like second hand stress and depression. And it’s just added to my own problems. God I can’t take this shit tbh. 

But I’m not gonna add to the drama by complaining or anything. Sigh.

Hi guys, 

First time posting and would really appreciate it if any of you guys have any tips for calming down.

Traditionally, I used to get sad as a teenager over things but as I got old it just became anger. Which I handled okay because I use to go running. Then my facial hair started falling out and all of a sudden I am feeling a lot more sad than angry.

I just feel like the world is put to get me and things aren't going right for me.

I feel like someone put a curse on me. Things were going well and now everything is just going awful.

Thanks for reading. xo

Long story short I moved away from Paris 9 months ago, left all my friends, arrived at the new country and feel like there's something stuck in my chest. Literally everyday for the past 9 months I have never felt relaxed or genuinely happy. I know I'm only 16 and I'm being dramatic, but it's so hard leaving everything behind. I'm constantly stressed about school, and my future, I'm graduating next year and I still don't know what I wanna do in life. The environment at school is so depressing, the people are toxic and the teachers are the same. I know I'm being dramatic but I feel like I'm drowning, I feel so lost. Everyone around me is always pointing out how negative and pessimistic I am but I can't fucking help it. Everyone has their shit together except me jdbqhdseqjhbvfqsjhbfjhfb<<kjfqbhjqsw

Post 822: The grass wasn’t greener.. it was just AstroTurf.
Content:
Been at my job for 10 months and I finally snapped today.. had a bit of a breakdown in my living room after driving home.

The workloads are ridiculous, legitimately everything is apparently “of the highest priority” and “must be sorted NOW”. The second I get in, my phone rings off the hook, emails flood my inbox and I firefight to keep barely on top of it all. If I ask for help I just get excuses or that it’s not in the budget for extra staff. I’m overwhelmed and i hate it.

Not to mention if anything does goes wrong, or is missed, everyone takes the opportunity to throw someone else under the bus - it’s horrible to watch. And experience in some instances.

I barely get time to have a break or eat, because if I take a second away from my desk I’ll pay for it when I come back. 

I’ve been in the company but different departments for about 2 years previous so if I leave I’ll miss out on all the benefits I’ve accumulated. I wish I’d never left my old team, I was spoilt with how simple life was and now I’ve had reality punch me in the face. Fuck me right? Who knows what I’m going to do, I’m looking everywhere for a new job but it’s slim pickings at the minute.. I’ll just try to keep upbeat and keep looking I guess.

Sorry it’s a long one.. just wanted to vent it out.

Post 823: Stressed about my future/moving
Content:
I just started my senior year of college. I have always been a future thinker and thought about the next best thing. I get so anxious about what is to come in a few years instead of focusing on my life right now. When I graduate I plan on moving closer to my boyfriend because even at my school we are long distance. He also is a year younger so he cannot move anytime soon because of schooling. My hometown is 3 and a half hours away from where I plan to move. I do not like my hometown so moving is not a huge deal to me, but I am really anxious and scared to be that far away from my family. I always wanted to move away, but now that it is coming up in the next year I am getting very anxious about it. I love my family and am sad about the thought of being away from them, but I have no social life and am unhappy there. Any advice on how to control my future thinking and allow myself to focus on right now? I get so anxious about things that will happen in the distant future that it seems to really affect my life now. Any advice on how to handle my stress better?

I have an eleven year old step sister that points out everyone’s flaws. I am in cheerleading, and she is to. She’s been in it longer, and can do more things than me. She says; “ew.” To everything I do, I can’t stand it. I do a cartwheel, “EW, YOUR CARTWHEELS UGLY!” Than she points out everyone’s looks, including mine! We were at the park, and she said; “you look really ugly right now.” I hate when children younger than me try to correct me. I waved at someone, and she said I wave weird. I’m really just stressed right now, I just don’t want her to point out my flaws anymore.

Post 825: How do I recover my creativity after stress?
Content:
Don't know if this is the right place for this, but I've searched other subs and this seems like the best place to me.

I've been through a lot of stress and maybe some undiagnosed depression in the last two years, between the death of a close loved one, job and financial stress, severe relationship problems, health issues, and a bad living situation. I existed just to go to work where my coworkers helped me de-stress and laugh, but slept until I had to leave and came home just to get in bed again. 

I'm a creative person with a lot of drive to make things, and this used to give me a lot of purpose in my life, but during this time I'd stopped doing almost anything but watching comedy specials on TV. 

I was finally on the upswing of all that and feeling more like myself, and finally got back into my writing, which is my passion. But my stress threshold is still fucked up so when, in March, I felt forced to quit my sewing job over a heated argument/fight with my boss, it broke me again. Not as bad as last year, but I lost the routine I'd just settled into, and most of the writing drive I had I've lost. I worked there for six years and had a strong role and responsibilities that I had integrated as part of my identity. That job felt like "who I am".

I had a comfortable, lax second job already that's now my main income and I'm fine there, and once again starting to come back out of that darkness. I'm able to do some crafting in bed but still spend most of my time with the TV on. I'm also getting a gentle morning routine going and that helps.

But the big problem is my creative drive. I WANT to create things. I'm investing money in a voice recording set up and I want to narrate, and write and read. I'm wasting time cross stitching for hours every night while I binge shows I don't really care about. When I have perfect chunks of time to do the things I crave getting back into, the motivation isn't there.

How do I do it? How do I get back into things I love when I've finally reached the other side of the stress? And, how do get myself strong again after so much, so that the next thing to come along doesn't break me all over again?

there's a lot of processes and systems and new technology that I have to learn in a relatively quick period.

that's creating a fair degree of stress

Post 827: Just a bunch of first world problems
Content:
I’m a freshman in college. I was one of those people who did well in high school without really trying. I knew it would be harder coming into college but a great first semester pulled me into a false sense of security. I’m currently sitting on a 3.1 (seriously, why are B’s so fucking detrimental?). This would be fine(ish), since I’m a comm major and nobody in my field of work (especially in my city) gives a shit about your academics in college. You can either do the job or you can’t. Problem is, my scholarships and aid are riding on my grades. I can’t afford to go to college without them. I never learnt proper studying or time management skills so I’m trying desperately to catch up, but I’m being buried under classes, orgs, and general life responsibilities. 

I stupidly thought that managing 12 hrs with only one class that has tests and no orgs meant I could do 15 hrs with three classes that test. Haha nope. I joined four orgs and paid the dues for all of them. Two of them I never attend because I don’t have time, so that’s $80 down the toilet. One of them wants too much time and the other is confusing and point opportunities are hard to come by. For the past two weeks the meetings that normally go until 8:30 have been running up on 10:30 instead. 

I’m trying to take care of things that would actually help me, like doctor and psych appointments. Doing this means I’m missing classes, meaning my grades suffer. I’m not seeing a therapist anymore because I don’t have time. There are so many things I have to do, fees I have to pay, papers I have to fill, etc. and I can’t do them all. My family says exercise and eat well. In what time? How do I stick to my calories when I’m constantly binging from stress? I’m getting back to my old weight and I hate it. I can’t stand the idea of anyone seeing me naked, so a love life (as if I’d have time for it) is out of the question.  

I’ll spend all day working and then realize I accomplished almost nothing because I was agonizing over a single task. But I need to be a perfectionist with these things because they are such a huge part of my grade. None of the things I do are interesting to me. I’m in an English and theatre course and I either hate them or can’t give them the dedication I want, despite the fact that I love those subjects. After every test I make a plan to study better but it quickly gets thrown to the wayside as other shit is piled onto my plate. So now I’m cramming and stressing. 

My room is a disaster. My side is always dirty because I’m too overwhelmed to pick it up. My roommate is a super light sleeper so I have to go to bed before I can finish my stuff just so she can get her sleep. And it’s not her fault, but I just want to yell “I’m sorry you can’t sleep, but I have shit to do. Let me fix my shitty GPA while you enjoy your 3.9, thanks.” 

This isn’t the half of it, but what I can get down before I have to get back to work. I’m sure some of these things have easy solutions but I’m too blinded by my stress, sadness, frustration, everything. I welcome any advice anyone may have. These problems are stupid and unimportant in the grand scheme of things, but I can’t ignore them. 

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this and just see me and how I feel.

Post 828: Stress related to low self esteem and surprisingly powerful coping strategy
Content:
Hi all,

I generally suffer from low self esteem. I have periods, where I feel completely worthless. It's not helped by the fact that I have to write weekly status reports at work.

When writing a status report, I have to make an account of the progress, I've made during the week. It takes roughly 15 to 20 minutes to write the report, and there's not much to put on to the list.

Or so I thought.

Last week I decided that I wanted to spare myself from the stress from writing the report and just write down my progress as it was made.

The list of completed work tasks were three times as long as ususal. Turns out I'm quite forgetful.

This was a major self worth boost, and it made today an all around great and satisfying day. :)

Not sure of this is the appropriate page, but here is goes: 

I'm currently in my third year of University. I'm and average student (though I want to get that up soon). I always turn in my work early or on time, I never really study for my classes but I manage to get passing scores. 

Anyway, I just wanted some advice because I've seem to have had no motivation and I've been turning in most my work in late and not keeping up I'm class. I'm not sure what's wrong. 

Though, I've been working out more and eating better. I still get moody, The first thing I usually do when I get home is just take my clothes off, switch off the lights and sleep. No major events in my life, just constant stress and wasting my time of wondering what I should be doing next rather than actually doing it. Getting overwhelmed or putting it off. 

Everything is just inconsistent... I'm not sure how to get it on the consistent side. 

What can I do?

Content:
I work on a team of 4, and we are extremely behind.  Our workload has tripled in the last year without adding additional headcount.  My coworker spends most of her day socializing and I am struggling to get my much heavier work load done.  She pretends she’s too busy to finish her work so others will help her and stays late so it appears she’s working hard.  My boss is in a different area so he doesn’t see it.  The stress of the workload is causing problems with my health.

My question is, is it reasonable to tell my boss what’s going on or does that make me seem like a troublemaker?

Content:
I don't know why but I'm really stressed out lately. Well maybe I do but being stress is so hard on me because I know damn well I ruined relationships with the people around me. It just started recently and I think the cause of me being stress is how I don't have the usual motivation to do good in my study anymore in result, I got upset with the product which is mainly guilt. I know it's my fault but I want to be on track again. Hope anyone who's reading this can give me some of the tip that helped you to relieve stress. Thank you for your time 💚

Post 834: To begin
Content:
I'm gonna start my story with who ever reads this I'm doing this as a way to get through the pain. So I ask you to keep everything positive and thank you. The 9th of January started off as any other day, the wife and I wake up and our beautiful little girl wakes up too. She gets ready for work and I help I dont work anymore because I am 90% disabled through the V.A., but she works at a daycare and takes the little one with her and before she left she asked " Can you clean up the apartment." and I replied with " Yea I can do that love you." and she left. So I started cleaning up the toys and I became light headed so I sat down, now this has been happening to me for the last few months more and more. Then I became nauseous when I sat down so I stumbled to the bathroom and puked which then caused an asthma attack which caused an anxiety attack. So I call a veteran's hospital I go to and talk to a nurse she told me to go the an emergency room. I hang up and call my wife to tell her what's happening and she says "dont go just go sit in the shower." I replied with " I'll try but I don't know if I can." I then call my brother to see if he can come from his job to take me. He is a Lt. in the local volunteer fire Co. and has medical experience. He heard how I sounded and said he was gonna hang up and call for and ambulance for me, he did so and then called me back to tell me it was on its was and that he's was going to call my wife to tell her. After he hangs up with her I get a text from my wife again telling me not to go. At this point a police officer shows up and I ended up going unconscious on him to wake to EMS trying to get me to the ambulance. I am taken to the closes hospital. I have to put this into multiple parts so watch for the next post.

Post 835: Stress in school
Content:
I need help with coping with stress in school. We get, on average, 1-2 hours of homework. Just to say, i'm in junior high. When I attempt to do homework; I get a raging headache and when I do bad or don't know something; I cry on the spot, or at least  shed a few tears. I don't want to take medications or talk to some people because most of my friends would say it's a joke. Sometimes, I can't get more than 2-3 hours of sleep because of this. Hope you could help me. If you think this is a solution. Nope, I can't switch schools because then I would "throw away my future." I do get good grades though and our grading system is a lot more strict. Is there anything I could do to get through this?

Post 836: Missed an exam
Content:
Alright cool, one of the most important math exams just happened today, I felt sick to my stomach not wanting to go to school (my school provides a second date if you miss the first one) and now, I realized I'm the only one who didn't do the exam, I feel uncomfortable as shit making my teacher write an entire exam all over again just for me, and the thing is, I don't think I was sick, I think I just felt like crap.

Post 837: How can I improve my stress threshold?
Content:
I get stressed very easily and very quickly. Loud noises are particular stressors, eg. Someone vacuuming or playing drums. 

I had a particularly stressful event occur today and my Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was at 198bpm. My resting heart rate is around 55bpm and often drops down to the 40s so this really scared me. 

Is there a way I can increase my ‘tolerance’ and threshold so that I am not getting stressed so easily? I run everyday and the exercise certainly helps my overall mood but I don’t feel it helps how easily I get stressed. 

Post 838: Physical reactions to stress

So I'm dealing with a lot of stress right now from a new job, and I've noticed my body behaving differently after I started working. I've been coughing a lot lately, I feel like I can't breath, some discomfort in my stomach from time to time. I don't know if this is normal? I was perfectly fine before the job, but should I go see a doctor?

Post 839: Already screwed up at new job and I feel terrible
Content:
I just started a new job, haven’t even been there a week yet, and I already screwed up. I work in an office, never worked in one before, so I’m still new, but I feel like my job is already in jeopardy. I was let off with a warning, but now I can’t make another mistake. It’s only been three days. I can’t disclose what happened for confidentiality reasons, but needless to say I feel really stressed out right now, and I don’t know what to do.

Post 841: I’m constantly stressed about money even though I’m debt free
Content:
I’ve had a normal upbringing, my parents were firmly middle class and saved up a lot. But they came from poor families. So they expect me to be as wealthy as they are (and more). 
I don’t have any debt which is great, and I’d like to get a mortgage soon as well, but I keep worrying about money. My partner has unsteady income which stresses me out on his behalf. I have a steady job, don’t make a fortune but it’s safe and have career prospects. 

I read somewhere that most milenials are worried about money. That doesn’t surprise me. Anyone else out there feel the same? 

Post 842: I am done
Content:
I have given my all to work. I have given almost my health to it. I have a troubled background that forced me to take responsibility early in my life.

Since that I have been taking responsibility of everything and landed in a high profile job leading a sales company. 

Now I am empty. I can barely function. The company is not doing well. I can’t change that even if I try as hard as I can. I have made a big decision and resigned but my contract keeps me there for January. 

How can I push this month and all the challenges there still are? How can I show example to my team and keep them pushing. I have nothing to give.

I gave too much. My stress is keeping me from eating, sleeping, smiling. 

I am done.

Post 845: Waitressing - MY MIND WONT STOP. How to destress and sleep at night?
Content:
I've been serving for 3 years now and it's come to the point where I've noticed work really affects me after I'm home. I get home after 10 hours and am physically so tired I should pass out immediately but my mind is going insane. I can't stop remembering orders or what people asked for and can't fall asleep for hours. My brain simply won't stop firing. I can try and drink a cup of tea wind down but when I lay in bed my brain just won't relax. Does anyone know the science behind it? Neurotransmitters won't sleep or what is going on, even after a few hours laying in bed? 

I love serving and I don't want to stop but I know longterm affects of stress on your body are detrimental.

Any advice or experience with this or ways to destress/handle the mental toll serving takes on you? And stop my brain from firing so I can sleep at night. 

Thanks in advance! 

Post 846: "I will never graduate" (advice please?)
Content:
I've been smart and have never had to try that hard in school. I would not do homework and cram the night before exams and pass. 

I'm in college now. I feel more enabled to miss class because teachers don't really care who shows up. So I miss class. 
Then I'm stressed about the material I missed, but I'm too anxious to contact the teacher because I think they don't like me because I missed class. 
So I distract myself and drown in Netflix until 4 am and sleep through all my classes, and when I am up for them I don't go because I'm anxious I will be put down by the teacher.

AND THUS The Cycle Continues... :(

any advice?
Intellectually I know it's irrational, but I can't help but feel that way

I've been diagnosed with Depression and Generalized Anxiety btw

Post 847: My Ongoing Journey with Stress and How to Cope
Content:
I find stress to be like most things in life good in moderation. I have found myself in many stressful situations at work that have forced me to focus on what's important and to get it done. 

With too little stress I find I have no motivation to move forward. 

Too much stress (or the wrong kind of stress) can be debilitating and possibly detrimental to your health. There have been many times where I have stressed myself out over what ifs that I end up saying fuck it or I end up in a ball on the floor sick to my stomach (whether it's going out by myself to see a friend's band, talking to a girl, or reaching out to others when I need help) and my mom has stressed herself out to the point where she's had panic attacks in the past.

It wasn't until the past few months that I've come to understand stress (or at least come to an understanding that helps me). For me stress boils down to a conflict between the way things are and the way I want them to be. For example, right now I am trying to launch a side business, maintain my 9-5, help my wife with our 9 month old son, and train for several up coming endurance events. I want things to go smoothly and find time for everything but life has other plans. 

A couple of months ago my team was working on a big release for our product and I had a pivotal role. There were some nights where there was never a break. I would put in a quick workout after work, cook dinner for my family, try to make some progress with my side business, and after my son went to bed I had to do some work for my 9-5. I felt overwhelmed. I felt guilty that I wasn't doing more. And most of all I felt like I wasn't good enough. I wasn't a good enough employee, I wasn't a good enough entrepreneur, I wasn't a good enough husband, and I wasn't a good enough father.

There was one night where I skipped dinner and just cried in bed....I had two options. 
1) Let the stress get the better of me and drop some of the things I am trying to do or 2) figure out a way to cope.

For me the first step in coping was mindful meditation, where I learned that I am NOT my thought and I am NOT my emotions. I learned to quiet my mind and focus. I learned how to separate myself from emotions. (I'm not saying that emotions are bad. I still feel everything but I don't allow them to control me or send me into a tail spin anymore).

My second step was realizing that the mental, physical, and emotional selves are interconnected and can go into a feedback loop.

Example: I had a call recently about my side business that I was nervous about. As the time for the call drew closer I got more nervous. Then I started to think "Who do you think you are to even try doing this" which fed into my nervousness to the point where I felt queazy. If I had allowed it to keep going I probably would've made myself sick. I stopped myself when I realized what was happening used some exercises I learned in my meditations. Once I was able to calm emotions I focused my mind to preparing for the call giving it no room to explore what ifs. It wasn't until later that I realized that once I was calm and focused my stomach settled as well.

My third step was to learn how to start gaining control of my mind, body, and emotions.

One of the techniques I use regularly is nasal breathing.

Did you know that breathing though your nose and into your stomach engages the parasympathetic nervous system. (The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the fight or flight response while the parasympathetic nervous system is more related to restoration and digestion)

So what does that mean? When you engage the parasympethic nervous system you short circuit the sympathetic nervous system effectively halting the fight or flight response.

As an added bonus focusing on your breath takes your mind off of the situation for the moment helping to calm down and focus once you return your attention to the situation at hand.

I still have times where I get stressed and depressed but I know have steps to cope with it. Sometimes it's a matter of lightening my load and other times it's changing my focus from what if to something tangible to move myself forward.

I know how debilitating stress can be and I hope my experiences/ongoing journey can help.

Post 848: Lost My Job, Feeling Stressed out and Worthless
Content:
f24
I lost my Job recently due to performance, not wanting to damage relationships I had built in my career I decided to quit instead of be fired and drag it all out. I was a great worker and my colleagues loved me, I just couldn't reach the targets they had set for me. 
I am currently searching for a new career but I am scared and stressed. I feel like everyone is judging me, I feel like I am not contributing. I don't want to change my personality just because I am jobless. But it seems that people expect me to act a different way (namely more housewife focused things like cooking and cleaning). I want to work on my artwork, but every time I do I feel crushing guilt and stress. I am applying for many jobs a day. 
I am not expecting anyone will even see this, sorry if this is the wrong sub. I am normally a lurker.

I can't get my program assignment to work, while every one else has theirs working like it was no problem, and whenever I ask for help, I feel like the professor is upset at me because it was something we learned about earlier in the semester. I do pay attention in class, but I have to get up at 5:00 AM to be able to make it to class at 7:00 AM for my PreCal class, and I have English 1A.

Post 852: Extreme stress since I'm 15
Content:
Am in my early 30s.  don't know where else to write. I've been living with chronic stress since I'm 15 and my life is basically trying to get rid of this stress day-to-day. The biggest problem is that doing nothing/chilling does not reduce my stress. It's like I have to find a purpose in life to live stress-free because other than finding purpose there isn't anything I really enjoy doing. I lost my joy in playing videogames, I only exercise and try to be productive and that's it. My friends and family give me joy but only to an extent. I have many hobbies but they only hype me very occasionally and for a brief period until my brain decides that it's not enjoyable anymore.

* When I was 15 I started having intense depersonalization/derealization. It was VERY overwhelming. It never disappeared since then but got less and I learned to live with it
* I've been chronically tired since then and even considered if I have ME/CFS. Maybe.
* My little brother basically says he doesn't know anybody who has such strong stress levels day-to-day
* There were a few times where I almost fainted due to unknown reasons (pre-syncope?). I don't have diabetes or anything.
* I look like a drug addict at times and people have told me this a few times
* I started getting heart skips/palpitations (PVCs/PACs) since the age of 22. They are very scary.
* I have chronic skin conditions
* I've had periods of panic attacks where I was even house-bound for a while
* I'm working in a very demanding job as an engineer in one of the most relevant companies of the latest years, which I don't know if I can keep up with too long
* I have extreme cognitive issues and forget things all the time, including names, but excessively so
* I kind of cope with sex (and love) addiction which is not healthy anymore (or was at times). I've engaged in a few dangerous situations that I'm not very proud of. I have an otherwise healthy and beautiful family (parents) that have raised me well. But somehow I slipped into that addiction. I also obsess over my girlfriends after a certain amount of time because they are my only source of happiness. I'm quite anxiously attached and never do harm, in fact I'm too much of a people pleaser. But neglecting myself makes me less interesting because I'm too afraid to loose them. Breakups are the absolute worst that can lead me into months of palpitations and intense sweating. I've had one very beautiful relationship for 4 years which changed me entirely and made me worry-free.
* I probably have ADHD and a few autistic traits. With only exacerbate the symptoms like a vicious cycle because when I'm at my worst I can't communicate well and that it turn makes it much worse. I've had to call in sick because of that before. These autistic traits vanish if my stress level is low, which happens maybe once every 2 years.
* A psychologist wasn't able to help me
* My life has been a rabbit hole of finding the one stressor that explains my health degrading over the years. I've been trying to find a root cause since I'm 15 and doctors have only been calling me a hypochondriac. While my symptoms are real and so is my mental health issue.

I don't know where to go. I can't find an appointment with a psychologist/psychiatrist and I'm hell scared of ADHD medication because I'm scared of getting more PVCs/PACs.

I don't know anymore. If it keeps on like this I will die from a heart condition for sure. I can feel my heart 24/7 without even touching my chest or neck. My grandpa died this way and my dad has high blood pressure.

Any sugguestions appreciated.

Hi,

I am going through a very stressful period. I have a new job and while I am doing all I can, the results (I’m in sales) are lacking. There is little I can do, honestly it’s not about my performance, but my boss is really putting pressure on me. 

Anyway I aheva always dealt with stress and anxiety and now I am back on the phase where I wake up stepping 4-5am with work matters running in my head. Anxiety just builds up as I try to get back to sleep. The work matters become so stressful that start dry heaving etc. 

How to acutely manage the stress / waking up during night? Any tips? 

Thanks a lot. It means a lot to me.

I'm going through a lot right now. Matter of fact, I've been going through a lot for years, but currently it's pretty bad. It's to the point that I'm barely eating. I've barely eaten one meal a day, and a small one at that, for the last few days. I ask 20 pounds overweight, so I can afford to lose, but I don't want to do it in this unhealthy manner. I'm struggling so bad right now. My husband got arrested for something minor a couple days ago, and he still hasn't called me. Idk if he doesn't want to or if he just forgot my number. He also needs medication, and I'm worried that he's not getting it. My life is such a train wreck, I even went to church this morning to get some relief, and I'm not even that religious. It helped a little, but now that I'm back home, I feel just as stressed again. 

Post 856: How Stress Affects Your Physical and Mental Health
Content:
Stress is the body’s reaction to perceived or actual detrimental events. The “fight-or-flight” response is set off, which makes one’s heart rate, respiration, muscles tense, and blood pressure rise in an attempt to defend themselves.

However, stress may mean various things to different people, and some can handle stress better than others. Stress can aid in work completion and damage prevention through restraint.

Although our bodies can withstand brief periods of the physical effects of stress, prolonged, chronic stress can have negative effects.

Stress is a complex and specific behavior in a range of circumstances.

Your body, your thoughts and feelings, and your behavior may all be impacted by stress symptoms. Being familiar with common stress symptoms can help you cope with them. There would be a lasting impact of stress on health and can cause several health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes.

Post 857: How to handle burnout when  you can’t leave your job?
Content:
Hi,

Putting this flair in case I am too detailed. I work a stressful job. I am also in debt and struggling to make ends meet so i picked a part time retail job as my second jobd. It doesn’t help that I have multiple psychiatric diagnosis including OCD, GAD, and PTSD. 

I am realizing that I have a big problem and I feel stuck which makes me feel even more defeated. I always knew i struggle with anxiety sure. My issue is the physical symptoms that have been just progressing pretty drastically and I am lying if a small part of me is not scared. Here are most of the symptoms currently:

- nausea
-gagging as if im gonna throw up hut obvi not eating much so its like dry throwing up???? Just awful 
-loss of appetite 
-poor sleep /nightmares/paranoia
-frequent panic attacks/ crying spells 
-sharp chest pain
- my resting pulse is averaging 110-130 ar highest
- fatigue and body aches
-dizziness and sometimes vertigo
- heartburn 
-the worst one personally: fevers. I wish i am joking. Like i literally will go through every symptom and have the chills and sweats etc. awful

Just the idea that i have to go to work tomorrow is causing me bad heartburn so im trying to chew tums as i write this. 

The problem is that i am not sure what to do? I am self supporting so i cant just quit and live with family ( i can only dream) but also im not exaggerating when i say i dont know how much i have it in me anymore. I have few days of PTO (3 days) that i plan to use  i just am wondering what is a more sustainable solution? 

Thank you

Post 858: Work burnout
Content:
Hi all,

First time experiencing what I think is a mental breakdown at work, and I really use some advice. My jobs have typically been relatively long hours. I worked in Finance for a couple of years. I'd usually finish work at around 8pm/9pm, and spend the rest of the evening studying for exams - either to 1am or 2am. This was during lockdown, and even when things were re-opening. I went for ages without seeing people. If I failed the exams, my job would be terminated. It was a bit stressful, but I totally managed. I did well in my exams, tough at times, but I was completely fine. It was three months of being very busy, but after, I had a more normal routine. I left that job two and a half years ago, to do what I thought would be my dream job. It was incredible for the first 6 months, almost too good to be true. I'd reliably finish around 7pm, and did not feel overwhelmed ever. I couldn't believe how relaxed it was. Then things got busy. Since Jun-2023 until Jun-2024, a 10pm finish (starting at 9:40am) would be a very very good day. I'd say for a year, mostly, working hours have easily been 9:40 am to midnight at least, often 2am, and at worst 5am. I had a panic attack in Feb-24, for the first time in my life. I had two weeks of leave in March which helped. Then, this Jul-24, it was suddenly quiet-ish for two weeks. I think everything caught up with me at once. I have not felt like myself for a few months. A constant voice in my head telling me I'm a failure, a "can't do" attitude, not wanting to eat, struggling to remember basic things, terrible short-term memory, cynicism, and a dread for the future. Against, this background, work has started to get busy, and my mind is not in a good state. I had a call this morning with my boss and the CFO. I was already in tears before the day started. I couldn't follow a single thing on that call. He asked if I understood what was going on - I had no idea. I just had to say "no, I'm sorry, I'm not following, and I need to be on sick leave." The people I work for are incredibly kind - my manager is amazing. I do not know how she does it. I think her hours are worse than mine. Every day I never ever want to let her down. But I just reached a limit that I could not push through today. I am going to the GP today for an appointment, as I need some support. But, I do not know how to handle this matter at work. We are a very small team, and for some reason, there is a reluctance to hire. Senior management know that if one of us has a funeral to attend, we are understaffed, and have to push back on work. This is freely known. There does not seem to be any room for unexpected leave. If I took time off, I will push more work onto others. The CFO will ask if I am better on Monday, and I have no answer for this question. I will not be better for a while (but know I will get there.) Has anyone been in this situation before and have any advice? Considering the following context - if you admit that you are struggling, there is nothing that can practically be done to alleviate that in the short term (we are already understaffed, and hiring for a relatively niche role takes time); a fear that highlighting this issue will flag you as a potential "liability" or someone "not coping" in the company, and you have worked so hard to build your reputation there as being a reliable pair of hands. Thank you

But my mental and physical state is constantly deteriorating to new levels of stress and anxiety. I don’t know how to not worry about everything for myself and for others around me. I am responsible for others around me too.  The elder daughter who always got hit every time my younger brother did a mistake.

Content:
27/f here, I am Molecular Biologist, I picked that profession cause I genuinely love it and I am curious by nature. I don't like monotonous jobs, I feel it drains my soul and I get bored easily. I worked 2 years in a start up lab, ended up on 5 types of meds. For the record, before that, I had undiagnosed Bipolar 2, but I was diagnosed with GAD years before. I loved pushing boundaries, but the work place was very toxic and pay was miserable. I quit because I thought I was going insane, for real, I couldn't handle it anymore, even tho I loved the challenge. Now I work in High School and teach Molecular Bilogy. I loveee teaching, I enjoy it, but in School, which is government led institution, I don't have much freedom to progress and pay is even worse than my previous job. And you are always under the thumb of some idiotic school leader, Principle, etc.I got a lot of job interviews for sales, lab work, PhDs, I get excited at first, but then I see how it would function in reality and I get overwhelmed. Sometimes I feel I am being disingenuous to myself, I know what I love, but I pick jobs that I enjoy less because they pay more. And when I do what I love, I feel horrible for not earning enough, and by enough I mean I can barely cover my basic living expenses. Which is mayor stressor, as it would be for anyone.

I’ve been suffering since two months now. Started off with a flu and sore throat. So since then even after taking the proper dosage of anti allergic medicines and flu medicines. I feel like i have like a bubble at the back of my throat which i keep on trying to push down by swallowing mucus. I also feel like i cant breathe if there isn’t good air flow around me. As soon as i hit the pillow flat or raised i start feeling some kind of nasal dripping in the back of my throat and i start trying to swallow mucus hoping it would clear out. Its is constant till i start doing something like reading but it can take sometimes up to two hours before i cant sleep. I also take melatonin 1.5mg which makes me sleepy and even if i sleep i wake up. I also thought its sleep apnea but the doctors say it’s not. After revisiting the ER three times, one doctor said its psychological and spoke to a psychiatrist who prescribed me Tab Cipralez 10 mg One tablet after breakfast, Cap Lyrica 75 mg if necessary. I was worried to start with the cipralez but now i cant take it any more, the constant urge to swallow the mucus the suffocation is killing me and making everything worse i was hoping if someone has been through this and could share their story. 
P.S generic name for Cipralez is Escitaopram (Cipralex)

Post 865: I am under a lot of stress.
Content:
I have been unhappy for over 20 years. Due to eithe r family screaming and yelling at me or others  and my mom used to scream and yell at me and made me cry.

4 years ago it got worse I lost my mom and my family talks to me sometimes they do and they don't they don't include me most of the time. 

My mom used to scream and yell at me and her favorite child used to do the same to me . And my siblings does it to they kids and I have flashbacks of how my mom treated me .

I am always alone and lonely . no friends or spouse and I tried to find a job either i get rejected or not hiring and my family thinks i am not trying to get a job .

I used to live with my mother favorite son and I clean the house up and says I never clean I am nasty and dirty not just me people always say I don't clean up .

It's too much favoritism in the family and I am not one of them . My siblings favor the youngest child over thee youngest. I am the youngest girl and I still get treated like crap.

I am stressed out all the time every job I applied for I never get either I don't have experience or they are not hiring or I go on an interview and say we will call you and they never do it stresses me out  and I call the manager the manager is not in I will leave number to call there is no call back.

I am a hard worker everyone thinks I am lazy and hate my guts even at my old jobs I worked at . I am very nice and shy I have social anxiety and why do people hate me even my family ? I feel like screaming. 

Post 866: Burnout?
Content:
For background context, I am a 42F and have had chronic stress since I was 14. Not the normal everyday stress but the just trying to survive everyday stress. At 14 I came home to an empty home and found out that my dad move across the state with my little brother. I spent the next 4 years sleeping on people’s couches and drifting to about 8 different “homes” in the process. In my vulnerable state at 16 I started dating a 21 year old abusive alcoholic. After 25 years and he turning into a drug addict, I finally got away and divorced him. He made a 6 figure income compare to my 1/3 income of what he made and I didn’t have family to fall back on. I wasn’t going to go back to sleeping on people’s couches with 3 kids in tow. I really thought I would be better once the divorce was finalized and ties were cut with him. It will be a year next month. I’ve done years of therapy and medication, but I’m so damn exhausted. I’m also in a stressful job where my plate has now become a pan that is overflowing with no support and it’s basically, just figure it. Anyway, I DO NOT say any of this for sympathy, but I’m wondering at what point does years of chronic stress call for an extended period of time off to maybe recuperate if that’s even possible? I just really feel like I have NOTHING left to give. And I have no energy to play with my 11 year old which makes me feel like a terrible mother. My 3 boys are the only reason I keep pushing but the push gets harder and harder everyday.

I can’t do this anymore. I can’t be a mom and a wife and a teacher anymore. It’s too much. I can’t do it anymore. I can’t be all the things for all the people. I’m done. 

Post 868: Emotional Numbness Under Stress
Content:
Hey everyone,

Lately, I've been experiencing something strange during times of high stress: I find it difficult to feel any emotions, and even faking them seems impossible. It's like my ability to smile, get angry, or even feel sad just shuts down. It's challenging to be nice or put on a fake smile, and even physically smiling becomes difficult. I don't feel physically cold, but I'm just emotionally numb.

Has anyone else gone through something similar? Is this normal?

Post 869: Does anyone else make a mess of every little thing when they are stressed?
Content:
I recently had a life stressor and now I feel like everything I do causes some kind of fire I have to put out. But once I put out that fire, a new one pops up. Everything feels like my fault (and most of it is), and no matter how hard I try, I feel like I can't fix anything. If anything, I feel like I'm only good at making things worse. It kills me when other people have to fix the problems I cause because I caused them, I should be the one who fixes them. I'm starting to get to a point where I'm always overwhelmed. I always feel like there is something I need to fix. I feel guilty when I'm not trying to fix something, but also I've been so overwhelmed that I feel mentally paralyzed. Does anyone else feel like this? 

Post 870: pausible ways that help manage stress?
Content:
I'm 18, I've been told I get stressed pretty easily even about simple things. To be honest I'm just realizing how often this happens, because I really didn't noticed or was conscious about it. It's not doing me any good, as expected, and I want to stop worrying and stressing too much about the smallest things. I want to know if there's any way, method, anything that helps to control or reduce this tendency, if it's okay to refer at it like that? I never heard an actually good advice for anxiety or stress because it all reduces to "just don't stress yourself so much, it's not that big of a deal". And indeed, most of the times it's not a big deal, but I'm sick of hearing that because I genuinely can't help but feel anxious, even if it's something managable or fixable. I'm currently in therapy to get help with this and because I've picked my skin for a long time (probably caused by the stress). I'm not seeing much results yet because I've just started but I really would like to know if someone else had experienced something similar, have any advice, or maybe we could help each other. I just want to hear something constructive from someone with experience for once and that it's not going to invalidate how I feel. Thanks (and sorry if it's not very clear, English is my second language)     

Post 871: What is the most stress you’ve ever been, and what did it to you you?
Content:
I currently missed my period for 3 weeks due to this, it’s always regular. 2 weeks ago I stopped sleeping for 2 weeks, threw up 4 times, had 6 panic attacks, fight or flight mode 24/7 all day no break. Heart racing 24/7 no break. Passed out too die to stress. And it was for a week I’m getting it again this week though. It was because I thought I had brain cancer. 

And I used to be stressed for like 4 months due to a breakup and a stalker. And I got hair shedding from itelogen effluvium. I shed 400 hairs a day from stress. And now my hair is thick and long and I’m scared I’ll get it again. Because I was so stressed. And my RIGHT ONLY eye and lip keep twitching everyday for a week and a half now. Anyone else used to have telogen effluvium before or has been as stressed as me and did you get it?

Post 873: How exactly do breathing techniques work?
Content:
One of the most common stress relief techniques I keep hearing over and over again is 'inhale for X seconds, hold your breath for X seconds, exhale for X seconds.'

Yeah, I have NEVER Been able to do that.

I do not control the rate at which I inhale or exhale, when I try I end up getting light headed, and holding my breath only stresses me out more.

Is this actual thing that people are able to do or this problem just a me thing? And if the answer to the first question is yes then does it actually work?

Post 874: Tension headaches
Content:
I get stressed very easily and somehow I’ve managed to develop a habit where I am always scrunching my eyebrows. I’ll do it without evening realising, even when I do realise and try to relax it doesnt work. I physically cannot relax the muscles in my forehead/eyebrows, theyre either raised or knitted together. This causes really bad pain in my forehead, anyone know something that can help?

Post 875: Made mistakes at work due to burnout and unclear expectations and i am having a breakdown
Content:
Basically, I worked a research job at a hospital this summer and transitioned to part time work through school. I’m in my last year of a bachelor of science. School got really hard and I’m trying to go to med school, and started to get really burnt out and anxious. I had no discussions about part-time work expectations prior to the semester other than I was supposed to work 10 hours a week. I always got a lot of flexibility and independence at work, so I put some projects on the back burner and assumed it would be okay, as it often was. 

However, my boss pulled me aside today and told me that my work for the last 4 months has not been satisfactory, that I’ve let the team down, and that he could fire me if he wanted to. I know that I wasn’t firing on all cylinders but I had no idea that I was falling so short of the mark. I don’t know why he waited 4 months instead of telling me when the problems started and now I feel like a huge fuck up.  I’m freaking out and I don’t know how to go to work moving forward without having a panic attack. Any advice is appreciated.

Post 876: A lot of stress is slowly killing me
Content:
I am under a lot of pressure because of extreme situations in my life which I feel many times powerless to resolve. It involved organized crime and atrocities. Sometimes, I feel my heart is giving out. I already have what I think was a stroke. I had an intense headache and the next day I woke up with my left hand numb. Numbness gradually subsided through a month if I am not mistaken and I don't have any more numbness. I try my best to deal with the stress by leading as normal life as possible, going for walks, listening to music, having sex. But the triggers are there and I can't really just walk away from the bad things in my life, specially knowing the effects of crimes have in other people, which might even be deadly. And I feeling powerless to help possible victims. 

Post 877: Deep rooted sleep stress
Content:
Hello fellow stressors, I was wondering if anyone could help figure out how to release stress for me? My stress doesn’t normally show up/feel like anything during the day but when I go to sleep I do everything from cry in my sleep, talk in my sleep, grind my teeth, have night terrors, tense my muscles (end up waking up with a painful body/neck). 

I’ve done all the normal things; bath, lavender spray, meditate before bed, no phone an hour before bed, sleepy tea etc. i feel like this is more deep rooted than I think and I’m wondering if there is a way to be to release it and feel a difference.

 I’m working on going to therapy (just trying to find one that takes my insurance). Someone suggested somatic workouts? Would love your thoughts!

Post 878: Brain shut down? Anyone else?
Content:
So far haven’t met anyone that also has this. I call it “finals brain” because this first happened to me during finals week in highschool and has continued well past college. During periods of burnout or extreme mental load I experience the following: unable to form a proper sentence or speak my thoughts, slurring my words, using the wrong words for things, tripping/ falling often, dropping items. I haven’t found an answer on google as to what this actually is aside from mental burnout and flight mode, but why the speech and motor issues??. It lasts 1-4 days and happens 2-3x a year, it always correlates with stress load. Anyone else??

Post 879: Stress symtoms are killing me
Content:
It's been three weeks since I've been having these weird stress symtoms where my head's been hurting and I have constant migraines, brain zaps/spasms, and an empty feeling on my head. 

The right side of my face feels a bit weak and my vision gets a bit blurry at times. My body feels like it's lost some sensation and numbness as ive been able to hold hot objects with ease, where others struggle with. 

I've been to my primary doctor and a neurologist already and both of them just dismiss me and tell me it's stressed since I still have my strength and balance.

I've had extremely bad anxiety before this and this just came out of nowhere and it feels like it's getting worst and now it's really scaring me and stressing me out as I feel like there's something seriously wrong with my head or brain. 

Can anybody else relate?

Post 881: at 16 huh?
Content:
so, i’m 16 years old and i’m already having a midlife crisis of sorts. the gist of it is this: i dont think i have enough time left to do what i want to do, who i want to be friends or be with or to even listen to my family’s advice or not.

i’ve had a history of stressful situations like this even before today, but i just kept it to myself because i didn’t want to open up. even damn porn is getting the better of me, its a shame i watch it at such a young age.

i feel like i’m stuck. nowhere to go to fucking breathe because what i want to do, i dont feel like it’s going to work out after highschool.

i’m scared. i feel alone.

Post 883: I shouldn’t be Stressed
Content:
I’m financially Stable, I don’t really have to study Hard, and I just don’t have anything I should be stressed about. I just keep stressing myself out on the smallest things.
I have Social anxiety and I don’t have anyone to talk or hang out with I’m very lonely, I love talking to people but everytime I do I just get really awkward and I feel like Im going to cry.
My day to day routine is to wake up, get ready for school, sit alone at school for hours with no human interaction, come home, then do nothing but scroll on my phone and go to bed at 12:00. I want to change but it’s so hard, I want to start a new hobby but I feel so bad using money.

Post 884: Has stress changed your health ?

Hi, so I was wondering if anyone has experience anything like this. Have you ever been so stressed for period of time that you began to have stomach issues, acid reflux’s, and heart palpations, or just any health changes in general.

Post 885: I have a burnout. How much can I be productive while still recovering from it?
Content:
I've had this burnout since 2 years ago and I'm still deep in it. My mental energy level is very low.

But I can't afford to just take another year of not getting stuff from my to-do list done.

So I want to be productive every day while avoiding that I don't recover from my burnout

How can I properly find out what my limit is? At what point am I supposed to stop working for the rest of the day?

I currently find myself after 1 hour I already feel like "ugh I really wanna stop working and ride my bike or play videogames or whatever is fun or relaxing" but then I have to keep myself away from productivity for the rest of the day.. which is long. Ill always be tempted to get back to work

So its better that I know exactly how much I should do on a day and then do all of it in the morning because thats where I can be productive, not later on the day.

But how much can I push without killing my burnout recovery?

Post 888: (22M) Head pressure even at minor inconveniences
Content:
My whole life I've been a little more anxious than the average person, but nothing that I couldn't control.

In the last 3 months, I started dealing with a lot of work-induced stress, to the point where I had to quit my job and drop out of college. At the time, I was experiencing the worst time of my life, with infernal-levels anxiety, extreme panic attacks and drowned in benzodiazepines.

Now I'm a little better. 1 week Klonopin-free (with a 10-days streak before that), no panic attacks, but when they do happen, they're definitely weaker than before. However, I'm feeling like my stress tolerance has grown shorter than before. Every little inconvenience makes my head feel "pressured" and "heavy". Sometimes I even feel dizzy. 

Any tips on that? Have you experienced this? Maybe a big stress-trauma that led to these symptoms? I'm definitely better but not 100% yet. Thanks!

Post 889: WHere does your stress come from and how do you cope? does writing out your things to do for the day help?
Content:
Hello im wondering for those that identify themselves as people who can get stressed easily how do you cope with it and where does this stress usually come from?  


For me its fearing that I won't be able to get everything important done and taking on too much work and fitting my things with many things to do.   


Im curious to know if writing down and planning your things at the start of the day helps you release your stress?   
When you write down a list of things do you follow the list of things to do and if they are all done by the end of the day does it make you feel better?  


I also find that i am not great with time management and the day is always ahead of me and i can't get everything i want completed. Staying up very late at night is also not healthy too.

Post 890: Is it chronic stress?
Content:
Hey guys, for about the past 2 and a half months I've been dealing with the strange health issues I've ever experienced. I've gotten checked by multiple doctors and they all say stress but I'm not sure. I know I have severe health anxiety so I've gone and convinced myself multiple times that I have some terrible illness. But these symptoms are just so unlike anything I've ever had before.

- I got dizzy and blacked out last month
- brain fog
- when I closed my eyes I got vertigo
- constant fatigue
- no appetite last month
- crazy appetite this month
- constant diaherra and really bad gut issues
- tension headaches
- weakness and sometimes pain in my limbs
- chest usually feels weird
- I dont have trouble breathing but it feels like there's a weight in my chest
- heart beats super fast very frequently
- my body falls apart really fast like I'll be sorta okay and then suddenly everything is terrible
- I'm exhausted but never actually tired
- increased panic attacks and anxiety because of all this

Does this sound like chronic stress to you guys? It probably is but my health anxiety is absolutely tearing me apart and I can't convince myself otherwise. What do you guys think?

This is like the worst I've ever felt before.

Post 892: Family history of dementia and I'm afraid of eventually suffering the same fate
Content:
I have a family history of dementia on my dad's side. Though, it seems it was largely stress induced (which i mean, makes some sense). My grandpa (95) is very far gone into dementia- had multiple strokes in his life and ptsd from ww2 + generally a rough life. His brother, whos even older (96), is in amazing condition and was still driving himself around and doing work around the house until about half a year ago. He is still very sharp and aware. My dad was a heavy alcoholic and abused prescriptions, and very obviously has nerve and brain damage from years of doing this. I have also watched my mom work herself half to death and family drama of both sides has been absolutely insane over the years.

The effects of chronic stress are evident in most my family members, both physically and mentally. I want to learn better stress management skills and avoid such health issues and mental deterioration as I can helpm But it's hard.

I have somewhat lofty goals. With school- Im an undergrad getting 2 majors and a minor + working on a research project that will be published im so excited like what??!). I am in my senior year now. Im hoping to go to grad school and pursuing a masters or ohd in linguistics. Im also working during this time. I travel semi often (currently studying abroad). Money does cause stress and Im working on dealijg with some very very old trauma and a resulting pain condition (if youre wondering, i made this acct for discovering said conditions and u can look at my post hist i guess). I also have a lot of hobbies but only really do art at the moment. I had a small issue with drinking that I recently nipped in the bud. I try to work out and eat better more oftwn but I just feel so burned out so often that i dont often do so (its been slowly getting a lil better tho!). I have a pretty bad sleep schedule thats been hard to fix.

I have some anxiety, moderate ocd, and pretty bad perfectionism.

I'm not sure how much of this is paranoia vs actual things I'm noticing, but I think I'm beginning to reach the point where stress might have long term effects on ny health.

Ive always had a bad social memory but I feel like my memory generally has been getting worse lately. This last winter and spring, I averaged like 6 hours of sleep a night and was living off of energy drinks (i try to get 0 sugar always, but i know thats not exactly healthy- its just bad in a slightly diff way...). I started getting mild heart palpations (which ive been more prone to every since o got them a lot during a hiiighly steessful period in high school). I was at work one day, after finally presenting a large project at my uni's synposium of undergrad reaearch, and I felt like I couldnt breathe randomly. I waited it out, and it lasted like an hr. It was kinda scary. I probably should have brought it up or sought some kind of medical attention but I didnt. Since then, I've tried to cut way down on caffine.

I have had a relatively stressful childhood, teenhood, and now young adulthood. I havent had a real break since starting college, as even in summers I end up travelling a lot and/or also doing summer classes.

I have been hella burned out a whilw now.

I want to find ways to manage stress better while also not giving up my goals. I want to still travel. I want my 2 degrees (and Im super close to having both anyways now). I want to do this project bc im so passionate about it. And i want to still have fun and do my hobbies.

Its just... so much sometimes.

Are there any good places to start looking for preventing the effects of chronic stress while living a crazy busy life?

I internalize everything that’s happening until I tuck in my kids for bed. Then I go for a drive and think about everything stressful. Blast some heavy music and tears inevitably follow. It’s my stress relief method when the gym is closed and there’s no one to talk to. Anyone else do this?

Sleep has been difficult and waking up at 4am for the past 3 weeks. At that point I have 2 choices: worry in bed or get to work. I come up with interesting ideas 💡 

But my body needs sleep. What are some practical ways to relax your body and mind? So far my response to stress is 
Exercise

Caffeine 
Motivational internet.

My mind has no rest, and I’d like help.

Post 901: My stomach hurts consistently every Wednesday.
Content:
So I've been in paramedic class for about a year now. I've noticed every Wednesday when we have class, I get this intense spike of pain every time I come in. Sometimes it's something that alleviates when I go to the bathroom, but it is always Wednesdays. I thought maybe it's the benadryl I take to help me sleep the night before, but that doesn't make sense. I thought it was because that was the only day of the week I get up early, but if I had to get up early for other things, I don't get pains at all, much less this intense. I'm not quite sure if it's something I should go to a doctor for.

Post 902: Pain in my entire body , diaphragm breathing helped
Content:
 

When the Covid pandemic began, I started experiencing progressive pain throughout my body, which could have been related to the virus, stress, or emotions during that time. It started with pain between my shoulder blades, followed by stiffness and cracking sounds in my neck. I also experienced lower back pain, tingling in my left foot, tendinitis in my elbow, and muscle pain when working out. Recently, my two left fingers have been slightly numb and painful.

I had X-rays done, which showed two small protrusions in my lumbar and thoracic spine, but they were not the cause of my pain. I also visited a neurologist and did some tests, including an electromyography, and everything was perfect. I went to a "special" clinic for Lyme disease and received a barely positive result. I underwent treatment for eight months with a combination of antibiotics and herbs, but I stopped because I wasn't seeing any progress and was experiencing many side effects.

\+ All my bloodwork came perfect .

It's been over three months since I stopped the treatment, and I'm feeling better way better than i was during treatment

NOW the biggest thing that i somehow found is :

IF i breath trough my stomach / diaphragm (something that i never did )  so much pain goes away its incredible , breathing like this for an entire day made me capable of  bending my back and do stuff with so much less pain, neck stiffness reduced extremely  i have no explanations for this

If i go back to my "old way" of breathing ( trough my chest/back ) i literally get so much pain , my entire back area gets inflamed & extremely painful to the point that i even start sweating.

Is this related to : stress & emotions / depression etc  ?

Has anyone dealt with stuff like this ?

Post 903: School stress is getting worse
Content:
Hi!
I just finished my second term today. I got my marks — great, btw. But the school stress has impacted me so badly that even now, when I’ve gone into end of the term break, I feel like there is something to be done. There are no homework assignments, no projects, nothing to be done, but still. It got to the point where I stress about non-school stuff — whether I showered or not, ate or not, read today or not; and sometimes, just stress, about literally nothing.
Maybe I’m writing this for validation, but I don’t think that’s what I need the most. Can someone help me control this damn situation.

Post 906: Lower back, butt and leg pain due to stress?
Content:
Has anyone else felt constant back & leg pain (or even general muscle pain on any part of the body due to stress? 

I have never had back problems, ever. Knock on wood, I’ve had no accidents, no sciatic issues, no joint issues, pinched nerve issues or broken bones etc.

That being said, I’ve been undergoing a lot of stress lately. The pain has been building up for a few days but tonight, I’m experiencing increased pain! Feels like the origin is the right side of my lower back and the pain radiates down through my butt cheek into my calf (pain is not travelling to foot). It‘s not a sharp pain. It’s more of a gnawing, dull but steady pain. Feels as if I’ve been punched HARD several times in the said area and I only get a bit of relief if I curl up in my side in the fetal position. 

I found literature online saying that stress can cause these symptoms but I just find it so bizarre. Am I really that fragile thay stress could cause so much havoc? I’m in my 30s. No major health issues. I did have mild covid 1.5 weeks ago though. The only other thing I can think of is the fact that I’ve been sitting a lot due to studying for exams nonstop. Weird because I’ve spent more time sitting and studying in the past, but had no back issues at that time. 

I will be seeing my doc next Monday so I will update the chat but wow this pain is gnarly.

I was just doing my homework as usual, nothing was on my mind it was actually just blank. And suddenly I start looking through my notes, specifically at all the marked out words and suddenly getting frustrated. But still, I wasn't thinking anything, mind blank. So unexpectedly I start stabbing my notebook and my pen breaks and then I start crying and hyperventilating, again, I have no idea what's happening or why I am crying. A few minutes after I stop and get back to normal, mind is still empty and I'm confused now and scared of myself, why would I do that. Yes, I am really stressed right now because of exams but I didn't know I would be stabbing a damn notebook for no reason. Can someone help me out? What could this be?

Post 913: Looking for different ways to cope with stress?
Content:
I’ve been scrolling this subreddit looking for ways to deal with stress. I’m a 22 year old college student. This past year I have completely shut myself out from the world (not literally), but mentally.

My mother was incarcerated recently. Her and her husband kicked my 18 year-old brother out (still don’t know why). My dad and I have a rocky relationship. With all of that, I’m a full-time student and looking for another job. With that being said, those events have taken a toll on me mentally. I feel so drained and emotionally overwhelmed. It’s started taking a toll on me physically. I don’t eat that often, have stopped exercise, barely leave the house, and quit my job. I don’t even remember the last time I got a good night rest (sleep without tossing and turning every hour). It’s been months. I feel so terrible. You can just look at me and tell i’m not myself.

What can I do to help manage my stress levels? I’m about to go back to therapy in a few weeks. I don’t know where to start aside from that. Any tips would be extremely helpful.

so im 23 and ive pretty much avoided jobs because of pretty bad anxiety.

I just recently got a decent job pretty much handed to me so I decided to take the opportunity but the anxiety from it is insane. Its not even really job related, its really just me being suuper insecure and shy and worrying about what they'll think of me.

Im getting heart palps, im sleeping bad, im exhausted, Im getting a bunch of muscle twitches, im super brain fogged...

I assume this will get better as time goes on and I feel more like acquainted to the people and job but right now its horrible. This wont kill me right?

I struggle with anxiety at work, and often find myself biting my nails or repeatedly clicking my pen as an outlet for my stress. At home, I use spinners and other various toys to keep my hands busy, but I feel silly bringing them into work, as a fidget spinner just doesn't seem fitting for the office environment. Are there any stress relief fidget toys/tools that you all use at work? Ideally something subtle and quiet!

I have this contant pressure like feeling in my brain. It's not exactly a headache but I always feel like my brain is not quite relaxed physically.It's like a weight over my head. I have tried meditation but ....it didn't really give me the desired output. I feel relieved only after my academic session is over or let's say I got really good grades/marks in my exams.i feel like the weight on my head got lifted. But it's not for long just a few days. When I start with my studies again I go into this state of mind where my head is constantly feeling heavy. It's being bothersome now as it effects my academics overall
How do I get out of this loop of heaviness and lightness in head?
Is this common?
Is it serious?
Any tips or advice or experience?

I have a 10yo daughter who has always seemed happy and carefree but sacred me tonight. She is very active in dance and cheer but has been upset recently about her dance instructor focusing on her being "pigeon-toed". She has also been talking a lot about her "arches" and her feet hurting outside of dance. Anyway, I picked her up from dance tonight and she seemed upset and said it was due to Ms Caitlyn talking about her feet again but then seemed fine. 10 minutes later out of nowhere she blurted out "this is really weird but sometimes I just want to jump out of the car" and started crying. When I asked her to explain it to me she said that her body wanted her to but her brain told her no. I was shocked and horrified and had no clue what to say or do. Does anyone have any advice? Please help.

Post 927: So much happened this week and i can't handle myself.
Content:
I am 28 years old and my birthday is tomorrow. I am not the one who cares much about my age or celebrates it. However i am having a very bad week and seem too stressed out. 

To start with, i was on a weekend trip with my girl friends to relax and meet after 2 long years. It was fun. But i am always the 3rd wheel in that friendship. They both are nice to me and they wish well for me. But i am the complete opposite of them. They are funny , crack jokes , extrovert and i am none of it. I just listen to them and enjoys the company sort of. They are good looking and can carry themselves. I am bit on the fatty side and does not look much good in the pictures. I think it always bothers me. 

Anyways , i come back from the trip and thought to stay with my boyfriend for some days. I feel lonely even when he is around. He gets very excited about his work and talks continuously about it. I am very much discouraged and demotivated by it even though i should not. He helped with a lot of stuff at work. I keep wondering why i am not excited as much as he is. I am interested in doing my work but i am not an expert. Just an average person at work. But i am a team lead too and the management part of comes easily for me. 

I normally handles the new joinee mentorship, any documentations, managing the team calls , setting up sessions. Somewhat what a culture team would do. I like doing this but i don't want to be known for it. Anyways past week, my department head called me up and said he sending some names selected for attending a training and asked to review it. I thought I might be in it but i was not. Every lead except me which made me very sad. I do not know why i was not even considered. I am not that bad. Yet again. 

This all happened when i was still at my boyfriend's place. I don't think he knows i was struggling with all this negative vibes happening. Still i thought i will hold my head high. I started going through my drive which the girls uploaded the pics of us. I don't normally go through it. I thought i might as well because my sister was asking for pics. So i selected some which i looked better with them. I thought i will send some good ones and some bad ones for the fun of it. The moment i send it, she replied telling me i look terrible in it. That I have put on too much weight and no one would tell this to my face. By that point, i was breaking down. I was crying hard and was feeling so much heavy in my heart. I was with my boyfriend and yet he does not know my heart was breaking with all the pain. I don't if i should blame him or I should have gone to him. May be he does not know i am struggling and i am not willing to tell him my struggles. 

So i texted my sister back, " yup, i know". I don't think she know i was upset. Then my second sister texted me saying i should take care of my health. Our family has diabetes genes. She was telling me the same thing. I was okay with her msging but i am very upset with the other sister for bitching about my weight. I only send pics to her. 

This all happened on Friday. At work, i did literally nothing. I could not do anything. I keep thinking about hypothetical scenarios and to wishful thinking if i could just leave everything behind. It was so much pain. 

Tomorrow is my birthday and i want to be alone..just alone. I don't know what to do. I don't know if this birthday is the thing that's making me miserable. But honestly i am not worried about getting aged. I am just tired. I know I should not expect people to come to you. But oh man I wish i could have someone who can feel me and i can open up to. I know i have people to talk. People will listen to me. But i can't open up to them. Everything is bottled up inside and i am so so stressed and sad and what not. 

I just wanted to write my miseries. Hope this helps me.

Post 928: My mind & body choses flight instead of fight.
Content:
 I (26F), am going through it tonight. Honestly? I couldn't tell if my post belonged in the anxiety or rant subreddit, but I asked myself aloud, "How do I feel?", and my answer was: stressed.

So, here I am. 

Crying and bawling my eyes out. 'Why?' you might ask. Well, I'll tell you a little bit about me...I am an overweight female who has gone through shit in my 26 years of living. My childhood was basically robbed of me, mainly because I witnessed fights and screaming matches between family members and a near divorce with the parentals. I was also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school. After all of this happened (and there was a lot more than that), I felt like I was forced to grow up and basically chose 'flight mode' to save myself.

What I mean by that is, closing myself off. Staying in my room and coming out when I absolutely have to. I have a fear of being rejected, and being a failure. I am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and I have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded.

I still live with my parents and I have no job because of just basically, being socially anxious. I stutter around people I don't know and that makes me even more anxious and self-conscious. I forget things easily and that in turn, furthers my fear of being incapable of a job. On top of that, I have trouble sleeping at night because thoughts run through my head a million times a second. Because of this, I wake up late almost everyday (at 11am).

Just tonight, my mom basically dumped a, 'we need to talk' case on me and already I felt my blood run cold. She's talking to me but all I hear is my heart thumping in my ears. She tells me I need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wakes up early like "adults". I felt very offended by that and told her that it's not my fault that I can't sleep properly at night. I, in fact, tell this to her everyday, so it's not old news. Yet, when I did remind her of this, she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes. Then she tells me I need a week to just 'work on myself' to fix that and realistically, thats not how that works but I didn't say anything.

Then she tells me I need to find a job. Something that pays and that 70% of the world gets up and does a 9 to 5 job which I already knew. Now, I was starting think she thinks I'm lazy or something when it's absolutely not the case.

Truth is, I have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing. We have been talking about it little by little. I told my mom this and she didn't seem to believe me, basically looking at me with an expression of, "Ohhh really like what".

So she asks, "Okay, what have y'all worked on today?" of all things she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning. I said, "Well, we are taking a break today but I designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up." my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said, 'That was it?' 

Not gonna lie, it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated 5 minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults. Meanwhile I'm here depressed, stressed and just over it at this point. Over the fact that she just doesn't understand at all. She says, 'I know you can do it. I know that.'

But does she really? Anytime I do, 'do it', she seemes to be unsatisfied and that pushes me a million steps back. 

I get upset and after we finish talking, I go to my room to sleep (11pm at this point) and I just start bawling at how useless I felt and the whole, 'why is my life like this'.

It took so much in me not to burst into tears in front of her but man my throat was tighrening so bad it hurt that I couldn't speak for a good few seconds.

I don't know, I guess I just need some advice on the situation? Anytime I'm in this position my stress literally goes through the roof and I don't know how to manage it (like the need to runaway, disappear or worse). I really do want to work, I want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things, but why am I always on flight mode all the time?

Content:
I’m a senior in high school and I get out early to work at four separate jobs a week. I don’t have many study halls and I’m really stressed on school work and learning on how to drive. I haven’t been able to do any of the stuff I like to do since I don’t have much time to do it. I’m also working on a personal project on my own subreddit that I haven’t felt motivated to do so. By this point I have trouble sleeping, and things like my brothers alarm clock or any loud noises in the mornings really stress me out a lot. I just don’t know what to do.

Post 930: How did the pandemic change your beliefs?
Content:
A friend of mine said that after the pandemic, he's started to budget a lot less to spend more money on travelling. His belief is, what's the point of saving if we all die! Funnily enough, before the pandemic, he was a cheapskate always saving and thinking long-term. Interesting to see him have changed this much.

A part of me agrees, and of course, disagrees. For me, I have started to find different things important that weren't so before, going out for dinner with friends, and prioritising experiences over materialistic goods. Crazy to think that 2 years went by in our lives that we'll never get back and how it changed our lives and will most likely impact how we think about how we spend our money and manage it forever in the future.

How did the pandemic change how you think of your personal finances?

Post 931: I can never relax my neck/shoulders/jaw...any tips?
Content:
First off, I have PTSD from being in the military. I overreact to stressors in my environment significantly. So I am totally aware of having higher stress levels than the average person. But what I do not understand is why my muscles stay tense 24/7.

I mainly feel this in my neck/jaw/shoulders area. I literally (and not saying this like "omg I literally died the other day when...but as in the way the term is actually meant for) feel like I cannot let my head relax into my pillow at night. It's like my body refuses to allow the pillow to take the weight of my head. I can consciously think, "ok, I'm gonna relax my neck now and let my head fall deep into this pillow," and it works...for a few fleeting moments until I stop actively thinking about it. Seconds later I will realize that my shoulders are up to my ears again, and my neck is no longer relaxing. 

I keep my jaw tense all the time as well. So much so that I have so many chipped teeth that my dentist has stopped fixing them until they get really bad. I have a bite guard for sleeping, but I think the damage is also done during the day. I asked my wife the other day which was "normal" for her: when not thinking about it, do your top and bottom teeth stay closed/touching each other, or is there a small gap? She went with the small gap, and I can see that my body wants that to be my normal too, but it is not. My teeth stay chomped down onto each other, nearly 24/7. I'd bet my neck and teeth stay tense even when I am asleep. 

I absolutely hate this. I can never get comfortable. I cannot sleep well. I look like a 10 year old with ADHD because I'm constantly wiggling around while seated in order to get some sort of comfort here and there. And all this misery boils down to the tension in these 3 areas. 

Anyone have any suggestions for this? I've told my Dr many times at the VA about this, and I have muscle relaxers, but rarely take them because they make me super sleepy during the day, and if I take them at night, I feel kinda hung over the next morning. So I only take them when in absolute discomfort. 

I go to a chiropractor 2x a week. I go to physical therapy for shoulder issues 2x a week. I regularly use a foam roller and a Chirp wheel, almost daily, several times a day. I even started yoga this week...but I've only been once so far. 

Oh, and I get a massage 2x a month, by a massage therapist at the chiropractor, who can target areas of concern from my chiropractic file. So not a feel good massage, but one that works on working knots out and loosening ligaments (not sure if I am using the right terminology there). Last week, after several months, she was able to finally "get in" my upper traps and for a few amazing, godly seconds, I actually felt true neck relaxation. It was so wonderful....and so sad when it quickly went back to my normal. But that fleeting glimpse of bliss told me that it is possible to find relief. 

So I have finally turned to Reddit to ask for help.
