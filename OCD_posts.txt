Post 1: Please read this before posting about feeling suicidal.
Content (Spoiler):
There has been an increase in the number of posts of individuals who are feeling suicidal. And to be perfectly honest, most of us have been isolated, scared, lonely, and there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world due to COVID.

Unfortunately, most of us in this community are not trained to handle mental health crises. While I and a handful of others are licensed professionals, an anonymous internet forum is not the best place to really provide the correct amount of help and support you need.

That being said, I’m not surprised that many of us in this community are struggling. For those who are struggling, you are not alone. I may be doing well now, but I have two attempts and OCD was a huge factor.

I have never regretted being stopped.

Since you are thinking of posting for help, you won't regret stopping yourself.

So, right now everything seems dark and you don’t see a way out. That’s ok. However, I guarantee you there is a light. Your eyes just have not adjusted yet.

So what can you do in this moment when everything just seems awful.

First off, if you have a plan and you intend on carrying out that plan, I very strongly suggest going to your nearest ER. If you do not feel like you can keep yourself safe, you need to be somewhere where others can keep you safe. Psych hospitals are not wonderful places, they can be scary and frustrating. but you will be around to leave the hospital and get yourself moving in a better direction.

If you are not actively planning to suicide but the thought is very loud and prominent in your head, let's start with some basics. When’s the last time you had food or water? Actual food; something with vegetables, grains, and protein. If you can’t remember or it’s been more than 4 to 5 hours, eat something and drink some water. Your brain cannot work if it does not have fuel.

Next, are you supposed to be sleeping right now? If the answer is yes go to bed. Turn on some soothing music or ambient sounds so that you can focus on the noise and the sounds rather than ruminating about how bad you feel.

If you can’t sleep, try progressive muscle relaxation or some breathing exercises. Have your brain focus on a scene that you find relaxing such as sitting on a beach and watching the waves rolling in or sitting by a brook and listening to the water. Go through each of your five senses and visualize as well as imagine what your senses would be feeling if you were in that space.

If you’re hydrated, fed, and properly rested, ask yourself these questions when is the last time you talked to an actual human being? And I do mean talking as in heard their actual voice. Phone calls count for this one. If it’s been a while. Call someone. It doesn’t matter who, just talk to an actual human being.

Go outside. Get in nature. This actually has research behind it. There is a bacteria or chemical in soil that also happens to be in the air that has mood boosting properties. There are literally countries where doctors will prescribe going for a walk in the woods to their patients.

When is the last time you did something creative? If depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder have gotten in the way of doing creative things that you love, pull out that sketchbook or that camera and just start doing things.

When’s the last time you did something kind for another human being? This may just be me as a social worker, but doing things for others, helps me feel better. So figure out a place you can volunteer and go do it.

When is the last time that you did something pleasurable just for pleasure's sake? Read a book take a bath. You will have to force yourself to do something but that’s OK.

You have worth and you can get through this. Like I said I have had two attempts and now I am a licensed social worker. Things do get better, you just have to get through the dark stuff first.

You will be ok and you can make it through this.

We are all rooting for you.

Post 2: Today I decided to "sit with my thought" without obsessing. I thought the anxiety would go away. It didn't. So I resisted compulsions for 8 fucking hours until the anxiety actually went away. This is my step towards recovery let's fucking go!
Content:
Hey everyone! Don't worry I'm alive haha. Had a really bad obsessive spiral for days so I was exhausted. But today I resisted compulsions for 8 hours! I hope this gives a little bit of hope to those who're struggling. If you're out there wondering is it possible to overcome severe OCD, then yes. Yes it is. 

The first step to recovery is when the pain of doing compulsions surpasses the pain of resisting them.

Post 3: Bro. There's dudes out there straight up murdering people and not feeling bad. Meanwhile, we're over here obsessing over things we did YEARS ago. F*ck OCD.
Content:
Real Event OCD*, for those wondering lol.

Post 4: Reminder: OCD can create not just intrusive thoughts, but also false feelings, sensations, and urges that "feel real" in the moment.
Content:
Here's a good article about this. https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/ocd-physical-sensations-and-urges

A common fearful experience expressed by people with OCD is that their thoughts have somehow evolved and they're no longer afraid of the possibility of some unwanted thing, but instead absolutely certain that the thing is 100% true and they were just in denial and lying to themselves all along. This is often provoked by some sort of physical sensation, urge, or feeling that emerged after the start of the OCD theme.

A lot of people conceive of OCD as only intrusive thoughts, rumination, and "what if" questions. This is far from the truth. The article I linked details a case of somatic OCD where the person was experiencing a genuine sensation that they needed to urinate at many times throughout the night, every night. After being referred to an OCD specialist and undergoing a course of ERP, the person learned to tolerate these feelings and the uncertainty around them, and the feelings lost their power and gradually dissipated over time. However, that didn't stop it from feeling 100% real in the moment, and the patient had spent considerable time and effort seeking out urologists to figure out and solve their problem.

I can speak from personal experience on this too. When I had what I now believe was somatic OCD about swallowing a couple years ago, it genuinely felt like every single bite was almost getting stuck in my throat. I agonized over it for weeks, convinced myself I either had an esophageal inflammation or some sort of precancerous growth, and eventually went to a GI specialist and got diagnosed with dysphagia. I went to a surgeon and got an endoscopy to identify the issue, and they found nothing obstructive or otherwise bad in the esophagus; only mild acid buildup in my stomach, something I've been dealing with on and off my whole life without any previous swallowing issues. I didn't know this was OCD at the time; I didn't realize I had OCD until my TOCD developed soon afterward and I did some research. If I had, I could have done a more appropriate course of treatment instead of spending nearly $1000 on pointless medical work in a foreign country I was visiting where I didn't speak the language.

*This isn't limited to somatic OCD either.* People with HOCD and POCD commonly experience false attractions that feel completely real in the moment. People with TOCD commonly experience false feelings of gender envy and/or dysphoria that feel completely real in the moment. I have experienced all of these things and more. 

In my experience, false feelings are much much harder to habituate to than intrusive thoughts. Where the intrusive thoughts create uncertainty, the false feelings 100% convince me that the feared thing is true, and send me into a disastrous spiral that usually lasts until the feelings go away for awhile. I'm still working on techniques to combat this, but I just found [this article](https://www.manhattancbt.com/hocd/) that, while focused on HOCD, includes some universally applicable advice on how to create uncertainty in moments you're 100% convinced that the feared thing is true (CTRL-F "Lloyd Christmas"). For example, when I'm 100% convinced I'm trans and in denial, usually when the false feelings are hitting hard, I can use these techniques to create a 20% possibility in my mind that I'm not trans and it's just the OCD acting up. Doing this too much can turn into harmful reassurance, but when you're stuck at the bottom of a huge downward spiral it can be a big help.

Remember that no matter how scary and real it feels, you are not the only one who's been through it, you are not alone, and you are more than your thoughts.

You are so fucking strong for getting up every day and dealing with this monster of an illness.  Things will not be like this forever , trust me. You are doing amazingly and I’m proud of you . Do not forget that.

Post 7: Don't know if anyone cares, but I reached two months of no compulsions without medication and doing ERP on my own!!!!
Content:
holy shit, in 8 hours it'll officially be my 60TH DAY of not doing compulsions. I did it myself! MYSELF! Fuck you existential OCD, fuck you. I win. This is it. I resisted for 2 fucking months, it's literally powerless over me now.

keep going guys, never stop. The moment you feel like giving in, that's when you push harder!

PS: There's nothing wrong with seeking help guys! It just wasn't an option for me.

And yes, you CAN do ERP on your own. It's possible.

PS: The redditors that DMd me, I'm so so happy I could help you all! :)

You guys aren't alone!

PS: Thank you for the INCREDIBLE support r/OCD!!!

Post 9: The worst part of OCD is you KNOW what you're doing is irrational, but you can't stop.
Content:
When I tell people about what OCD puts me through often the first thing they say is, "But you know washing your hands three times won't stop you drowning in a lake, right? That doesn't make sense." I have to explain to them that the sick part of OCD is, as we all know, we *do* know that the rituals aren't connected to our obsessions but we feel compelled to do them anyway. 

When I see a news story about a rare disease I may have risk factors for and worry I might get it and it might ruin my life, I know the rational response is "I don't have that disease right now and I can't control if I get it, so the best thing to do is just relax and worry about it if I get it." But I still worry about it and do mental compulsions trying to convince myself I won't get it incessantly. When I have a memory of an old fight with a friend from years ago and worry I'm a bad person, I know the rational response is "It was years ago, it makes no difference now, just forget it." But I still endlessly look for reassurances I didn't do anything wrong and my friend doesn't have bad memories of me.

Sometimes it all just gets so exhausting.

Post 10: Does anyone else proof read every email they send 10+ times?
Content:
I’m always afraid that I somehow accidentally slipped an insult, racial slur, nude photo, or whatever else in there without noticing and spend way too much time proofreading.

Post 11: I'm convinced that OCD causes a complete inability to handle guilt.
Content:
I simply do not experience guilt like other people do, and I'be noticed other people with OCD have this issue as well. When healthy people feel guilt, they are still able to function and eventually get over it. When I experience guilt about something, I literally obssess over it for days or weeks, convinced I am the most horrible person in the world and deserve to die. This is not an exageration, it's literally how I feel. 

Fuck, most emotions are not handled normally by my brain. Anger, jealousy, fear etc are much more intense. I'm simply inequiped to process emotions like a mature, adult human being. 

It's such an exhausting way to live and I'm so tired of it.

Post 15: Does anyone else shake their head to “get rid of” an intrusive thought?
Content:
I can’t help it. If it’s too scary or disturbing I don’t want to experience the thought so I try to shake my head to get rid of it. 

My therapist actually said doing this was bad, and that instead I needed to sit with the uncomfortable feeling and acknowledge that it is just an intrusive thought. 

Sometimes it is just too disturbing to sit with and I want it out of my mind as quickly as possible. How do you even try to sit with something like that.

Post 16: anyone else did this as a child without knowing it was OCD?
Content:
did anyone else pray before going to bed wishing every person they cared about was going to be safe and happy and if they missed someone or get the order 'wrong' had to restart all over again? just me? I wasn't even religious dude what the fuck, no one ever even told me I was supposed to pray😭 I did it mentally because I was scared my parents were going to find out I was praying and be weirded out 😭

Post 17: THIS IS A SUPPORT SUBREDDIT FOR PEOPLE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS.
Content:
Actual OCD is not "oh this number is evenly rounded, it's so satisfying" or "this crooked picture is driving me crazy".  Actual OCD is constant intrusive thoughts, compulsions so intense you physically cannot stop yourself from doing them....actual OCD is scary, frustrating, and can be miserable and debilitating.

https://iocdf.org/about-ocd/

That said, all those posts about things looking satisfying or annoying or whatever...they don't belong here.  Those aren't what OCD is and posting that here does nothing but perpetuate an inaccurate stereotype.

If anyone posts that stuff here they're getting banned.  Period.  You can say "oh I didn't know that's what OCD really is" if you want but if you took just five seconds to look around it'd be pretty darn clear that this isn't the subreddit for that.  Your ignorance I can understand, some people just don't know.  Being so lazy you can't take just a few moments to look around and read the rules to realize "hmm yeah maybe that doesn't belong here"...that's a little less forgivable.

We're a mental health support subreddit, not a place for your stigmatizing shitposts.  Take it to /r/mildlyinfuriating or /r/oddlysatisfying.

I greatly appreciate if users can please report any posts like that you see, because anyone posting stuff like that here is getting banned. 

I honestly can't believe this even needs to be said, but here we are.

Post 18: What are some things you hate doing because your OCD gets in the way of it?

personally, i hate having to take a shit bc then i end up washing my hands at LEAST 3 times w hella soap before feeling decently clean 😭💀

Edit: some ppl replied saying things like their lives and such. i just want you guys to remember that OCD is a terribly draining mental disorder and you’re not alone ! also please remember that you can and WILL push through it ! you are loved and please take care and stay safe ! :) <3 

also i can’t respond to everyone but please know that you are all very much appreciated and it does get better :( it might feel like the end of the world but it’s NOT and you are still living !!! 💕💕 sending lots of support to all of you

Post 19: Bad News Everyone
Content:
I have cancer. And covid. And multiple other extremely rare degenerative diseases that will probably kill me within the next month. This would be hard enough to deal with if it wasn’t for the fact that everyone I know secretly hates my guts. Everyone. Even my friends who all claim to like me and strangers who are nice to me and my family who tells me they love me. They all secretly hate me. It’s probably because they can tell that deep down I’m a closeted incestuous pedophile who’s in the early stages of schizophrenia, and would drive his car into a pedestrian or punt a baby if given the chance. It’s a tough situation but I take solace in the fact that none of this is real and I’m living in a simulation. 

Brought to you by my brain. Hope this made you laugh ❤️

EDIT: Sorry to frighten some of you, wasn’t expecting that haha, just wanted to make light of things. I’m also doing pretty well 👍🏻

Post 20: Hi! I'm an OCD therapist, and I'm new to reddit.
Content:
Hi OCD Community! I am a clinical psychologist that specializes in OCD. 

I just joined reddit today. 

My goal is to engage in a new way with the OCD community. 

In my day job, I engage with OCD sufferers as clients, and this places certain limitations on our interactions. Like all relationships, therapists and clients step into roles. There are things that clients will tell me that they don't tell others. And there are things that clients tell others that they won't tell me. 

So I came to this place that probably has the most raw and honest dialogue about OCD. 

I came here to learn.... I want to learn by observing what people find comforting and supportive. 

At times I might ask some questions to get a sense of the community's attitudes and perspectives on certain aspects of OCD that are not commonly discussed. 

At times I might "test out" blog post ideas by sharing educational concepts and analogies, and seeing how people respond. 

I hope that joining this community will help me become a better therapist and educator to my clients and the OCD community.

Post 21: The way OCD can leave us traumatized isn’t talked about at all…
Content:
Like i said, the way OCD can leave us traumatized isn’t talked about at all like there’s not even a single article about it &amp; it’s always about the other way around (trauma causing OCD).
OCD will make you lose your own identity, it will make you hate yourself, it won’t let you get sleep, throw you into a depression, play your worst fears on a loop all the time and more terrifying things. And then it’s so hard to love and trust yourself after all you went through with your own mind. It’s just traumatizing.
The fact that I wouldn’t even wish it to my worst enemy says a lot.

Post 22: It makes me sad that there are probably millions of OCD people out there suffering but don’t know it cause media portrays OCD as being clean and organized

So if you can, help spread awareness about OCD.

Post 23: I FUCKING BEAT OCD
Content:
FOR MONTHS I HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO TO REGULAR THINGS BECAUSE IF MY OCD. I CANT VRING MY PHONE OUT OF MY ROOM, I HAVE 40 MINUTE HANDWAHSING RITUALS, AND A BUNCH IF OTHER DELIBITATING SHIT THATS RUINED MY LIFE

BUT SUDDENLY WHEN I WAS IN THE SHOWER A FEW MINUTES AGO SOMETHING IN MY BRAIN SNAPPED AND I DIDNT CARE ANYMORE??!!!!!!!

I WENT INTO MY ROOM AND GOT MY PHONE AND PUT IN ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER. I HAVENT DONE THIS AT ALL THIS YEAR. 

MY HEART IS POUNDING BUT I DONT EVEN HAVE THE URGE TO DO MY COMPULSIONS OR ANYTHING.

THIS IS SO EXCITING

Post 24: Your OCD theme is irrelevant
Content:
One of the most important things I've learned (and often don't remember) about OCD is that the content /theme is irrelevant. It's a misfiring signal from your brain that is sending the thoughts and your reaction to this is the problem.

You might have contamination OCD and get the thought that you've got germs on your hands, even after washing them 20 times. Another person might have scrupulosity and say the same prayer 50 times to try and get it right. It doesn't matter what the theme is, it's all a misfiring of the brain, and our erroneous reactions to these misfirings that is the real problem.

I often catch myself spending maybe hours trying to solve a problem, which when "resolved" just generates another. If, every time, I remembered that the content is irrelevant, and just lived with the uncertainty, fear, etc, this would eventually show my brain that bad things aren't gonna happen and I can just continue with my day

OCD is like dominoes. You  knock down one (compulsion) and end up setting off a chain reaction. This can lead to an obsessive loop and feelings of emptiness, depression etc.

I want to focus on just letting the thoughts be there, whatever the content, because the content doesn't matter. This way I hope to fix my broken brain

Post 25: Stop for a second 🛑
Content:
Breathe.

Things will be fine.

You deserve happiness.

Don’t beat yourself up.

Stop checking feelings, stop ruminations. 

Don’t interact with your thoughts, watch them.

Breathe.

You’re not disgusting or evil or a monster.

Nobody’s judging you.

It’s all in your head.

Whatever you did, forgive yourself.

Breathe.

Take a minute.

Breathe.

Post 26: Treat your OCD like Jim treats Dwight
Content:
I've been watching the US version of The Office, and I realized something. You know how Dwight comes up with plots and schemes and general nonsense, and Jim usually agrees with him without really agreeing with him? How he usually doesn't put up an active resistance against Dwight, he just lets Dwight's lunacy sail right past him?

Do that. Do that to your OCD. The next time your OCD tells you something nuts, look off into the camera that isn't there and remember that you are not your thoughts. Be the Jim of your own story.

Post 27: I’m starting to think that the worst part of OCD (at least for me) is the overwhelming mental fatigue.
Content:
My mind’s both so busy and so exhausted, I’m just done with it all.  The obsessions and ruminations are overwhelming me.  I miss back when my head was quiet and peaceful.

I don’t know why I’m saying this, I guess I really just need to vent.  But ironically, I don’t feel like I have the mental capacity (as of right now) to actually vent, so I guess I’m just going to type out two paragraphs and call it a day.

EDIT: a word or two.

Post 28: My psychology professor explained OCD so wonderfully, I wanted to share.
Content:
She said “have you ever gotten out of you car and started walking away and wondered “did I lock my car” how far back are you willing to walk to check? 5 yards, 15, 30? A person with untreated OCD will have to go back and check regardless of the distance. The obsession here is possibly having an unlocked car. The compulsion (also referred to as a ritual) is going back to check. In this example the person can’t shake it off and will constantly be thinking about the chance their car is unlocked. From there thoughts will spiral and catastropize into “someone will break in and steal my things/my car” “I can’t afford a new car to replace the stolen one” and so on all with varying degree of “if I don’t go back and do the ritual then X bad things are going to happen.”

Post 29: Why the fuck do people not wash their hands after using the bathroom?
Content:
Hi, I’m a 21 y/o man w contamination ocd. I wanna know if anyone else has thought this? I think it’s common knowledge that men & ladies, a lot don’t wash after using the bathroom and being a man I see it all the time, guys just walking out the public restroom and walking right past the sink. Look, I clean myself very well in the shower but see, I don’t care how clean you think you are and I don’t care WHO you are—I think it’s gross that people can use the bathroom and not wash. I don’t want you touching your privates or wiping your asshole or whatever and come try to shake hands or go and touch everything else that other people will be as well. There’s 86 thousand seconds in a day and washing your hands takes 20 bare minimum. 

Post 30: watching this made me realize how ocd doesn’t just affect the person suffering from it but how debilitating it can be towards relationships and to get help before it gets worse

Maybe all those people could have been spared if bobby just counted right. Damn bobby piece of shit missed his 7s again and look at all the suffering.  


Let's pledge to work hard in combating this illness together. Resist compulsions, push towards getting better, I want my fucking life back. I'm absolutely fed up and disgusted with this illness. I WANT my life back and I will get help.

&#x200B;

I went to the psychiatric hospital yesterday, I'm gonna go there every week and dedicate myself to getting past 10 years of this nonsensical clown disorder.

&#x200B;

I want to lead a normal life, have 2-3 close friends, a stable job, get married, take care of everyone around me and be a productive member of society. I want to have a dog, a small cozy house and a meaningful life. I won't stop until I get want I want. I no longer wish to live in irrational fear of shit that isn't even happening.

Post 40: Anyone OBSESSED with completely emptying bladder before you can fall asleep?
Content:
Ive had OCD since I was a child, but recently I developed some sort of OCD around having to empty my bladder completely before I can convince myself to fall asleep. Even after emptying my bladder, any slight feeling in my bladder will make me want to leave my bed and empty that one drop of piss.

The severity fluctuate between nights but last night was really bad (left my bed > 20 times). It has taken a toll on my already very poor sleep (I've had insomnia even before this OCD started).

Can anyone relate to this? How does one resist the urge to perform my compulsions?

Post 41: I am so fucking proud of you all
Content:
This disorder is one of the hardest things a human can face. I am so goddamn proud of all of you for waking up every day and just trying. I’m proud that you’re here, on this subreddit, because that means you’re aware and you’re fighting. Today might have been a hard day for you, it was hard for me too. But I want you to pat yourself on the back right now. Take a moment to acknowledge just how far you’ve come in your journey. Reflect on your strength, and how you’ve always made it to other side of suffering. I love you all 💛

Post 42: If No One Has Told You Today
Content:
I’m so proud of you.

From this day and every day here on out. 

Your negative thoughts pale in comparison to the way you move so beautifully through the world with care.

Post 43: There is absolutely NO NEED for the amount of anxiety that past event brings you.
Content:
No, you don't need to know exactly what happened.

No, you don't need to ask your mom or your friends if they think what you did was acceptable.

No, your not worse then a murderer cus you called someone a bad name, kissed someone you weren't supposed to, drove drunk as a teen or whatever other kind of memory your ocd may be latching to. 

You fall into a gray area. Most likely, your ocd has made you suffer enough already there is no point in suffering more. Don't try to force these thoughts out of your head. Come to terms with them and move on, it does no good to dwell on it when because of your ocd you already know your going to get no where. I wish I could take your brain out of your body, give it a smack, put it back in and boom ocd all fixed but that's not possible. You got this.

Post 45: Remember OCD distorts your perception of reality... !
Content:
ocd distorts your perception of reality to make you believe your fears and thoughts.

it makes it see so real even though you know its not, it FEELS real. 

sometimes you may even give into actually believing it if it gets severe enough. 

ocd changes the way you think. 

you do not think like a normal person your mind is atypical. 

you can fall into a state where its like your daydreaming while awake dissociated, even dpdr.

you may even question if your going crazy cause of your odd experiences. 

so if your "reality" or "perception" seems weird don't panic its probably just ocd again.

Post 46: If you like having OCD, you don’t have OCD.

I’ve seen lots of videos of interviews where celebrities claim they have OCD then say they enjoy having it and it is a part of them. Well, OCD is a part of you - if you have it - but there is nothing to like about it.

Post 47: Does anyone else have an OCD-fuelled fear of being "cancelled"?
Content:
Throwaway because this is a subject I'm mega anxious about!!!

Basically, the title: Does anyone else have really distressing obsessive thoughts about being "cancelled" online/losing their livelihood etc. because of stupid things they did as a teen? I'm just petrified that people will find out about bad stuff from my past, they'll tell my employer, I'll lose my job and never find one again, my life will be ruined, that kind of thing. When the thoughts hit they just cycle and cycle around my brain and I find it so hard to function because what's the point in doing anything if my life will eventually be ruined for things I regret doing? I have to go through all of these compulsive behaviors like Googling my name to see if anything bad comes up and seeking reassurance from loved ones just to feel slightly better, and even then the fear still remains a bit. 

Am I totally alone in feeling this way, or have other people experienced it to? If so, how did you manage to overcome it?

It was absolutely disgusting (so much dead skin ugh), and I had to go down to my apartment building’s laundry room at six am to avoid dealing with other people making my compulsions worse, but I made it through!! I’m currently freshly showered, snuggled up in my new clean sheets, and feeling on top of the world and needed to share it with someone :D

OCD: " You should wash your hands till the skin tears off." No I won't, fuck you.

OCD: "You might have cancer, you should google and seek reassurance for hours!" . No I won't do that, fuck you.

Do everything your OCD is telling you NOT to do . Starve it. Crush it. Be merciless. You don't have to take this anymore. You can stand up. And you will.

Post 55: How I’d explain OCD to someone who doesn’t understand it
Content:
Imagine your brain is a computer (which it is), and it was corrupted with a virus (your OCD). 

Obsessive and intrusive thoughts are like unwanted pop ups appearing all over the screen whenever you’re trying to get things done like work or simply relax by watching a movie. 

The compulsions are essentially you clicking off the pop ups but every time you close one another two appear exacerbating the problem. However OCD has conditioned you to think that closing the pop up is the solution to your problems so it becomes a self sufficient cycle. 

The best way to combat this is by not reacting to the thoughts because they aren’t you. Or by downloading antivirus software (prescribed medication or therapy ahaha). However ultimately what you have to remember is that your thoughts don’t define you, the same way the virus isn’t the fault of your computer. 

Feel free to make any additions or changes to this, I just thought people might resonate with it. If this helps at least one person then my day’s been made :) stay safe people.

TLDR: Your brain’s a computer, OCD is a virus, every obsession is a pop up, every click of the “X” is a compulsion. You need to deal with the root of the problem not the symptoms :)

Edit: not one for award speech edits but just wanted to say how happy I am that this has helped a lot of people put what they’re experiencing into words. I wish I could reply to every comment, but if anyone needs someone to talk to my messages are open.

You have the best morals. (Think of all the things you’re worried about and say “wow! I’m so glad that’s my fear. it must mean I’m a great person”) take deep breaths. I love you. You are worth everything. You are here for a purpose. You are NOT meant to live in agony. It will get better. Stay here, fight. You can do this. And if anyone needs an ear, MESSAGE ME. You’re valued and heard. Peace be with you all.

To preface, I 110% believe ERP to work and I understand why it does. I know that it has really good outcomes for the most part and am NOT in the business of denying the data. 

I just think it fucking sucks that the treatment is essentially you having to consent to being tortured. It feels like I’ve gotta go through a Clockwork Orange-ass desensitization process that consists of pure pain and misery until my brain is conditioned out of it. It feels so abysmally cruel and near barbaric.

I know it’s NOT because I know my fears aren’t founded in as much reality as I would like to believe, but holy fuck the feeling is so real. It’s horrifying to willingly participate in something that makes me fear for my life. I hate it so much. LMAO

This is the reason why I've had upsetting thoughts about my family and friends and no one else and why my OCD stops me playing video games that I love but not boring things. I find it really really hard to play my one of my favourite games, Football Manager, because its like my brain is actively on the look out for triggers to ruin it for me. I've had to quit so many promising saves because of this but the only reason I have these thoughts is because I'm trying hard for them not to ruin my experience that I end up letting them.

Post 72: Reminder: it really is the OCD talking.
Content:
I’ve had the most horrendous intrusive thoughts. The most threatening themes that made me question my humanity and core values. I attacked myself over and over and ran in circles fighting it, questioning myself. I even dredged up old memories from the depth of my mind to prove OCD right.

I want to tell you it’s all bullshit. You are a good person. Trust yourself. I’ve learnt from this forum that reassurance seeking is a type of compulsion and to just sit with the discomfort. Even when it feels like “this time is different”. I am here to tell you that it’s not. It’s all the same, it’s all OCD up to its usual tricks. This too shall pass, friend. I promise you. I sat with my anxiety and let the thoughts pass and sure enough, I made it out on the other side and felt the fog clear. 

If you’re battling with this, trust yourself and trust the process.

Have you ever thought to yourself “damn, I’m really trippin cause a few chemicals in my brain are making me wacky”. It feels real. All the pain and sadness feels so real and to some extent it is. But ultimately, it’s nonsense. The view you have of yourself, the way you feel and the way you hurt inside ultimately is just a twisted figment of your imagination. I’m in a constant state of mental anguish; but sometimes, when I find myself stuck in my head or ruminating about some bullshit, I remember that my brain is lying to me and I don’t have to listen……..and neither should you. Hope you’re all doing well in these troubling times ❤️

Post 74: Accidentally glanced at the sun. OCD is telling me I'll be blind by tomorrow.
Content:
Woke up this morning and saw a TikTok about a woman who looked at the last solar eclipse for about 10 seconds and got partial blindness.

My kids and I had eclipse glasses and went out to check out the partial solar eclipse. Everything was going good and we were being so careful. But after I checked out the eclipse, I turned to remove my glasses but didn't realize the sun's reflecting was shining on the window of the car behind us and flashed in my eye.

I flinched away instantly, but now my left eye is watery and hurting a bit. I remember glances at the sun in the past, but don't recall these symptoms.

I hope it's all in my head, but OCD is in my ear telling me that I'll wake up tomorrow with a blind spot. 🤦🏽‍♀️

I doubt I'm the only one with this fear today. Please tell me you all have accidentally glanced at the sun and are fine. 😂

What the title says. Sometimes my OCD gets so bad that I can't go on social media or watch anything, because of the triggers from the bad things that happen in the world and conflict/dark topics. I was just wondering if anybody here has good suggestions for comfort shows they watch that are mostly stress free? I really appreciate wholesome content like studio ghibli movies, because normally the conflicts aren't super intense and they make me feel happier about the world afterwards. Thank you!

Post 80: People don’t talk enough about the long-term harm OCD has on a person’s deepest core self-image and world view
Content:
Spending nearly all your waking hours obsessing over social mistakes, unable to process them like others, will lead to an inferiority complex. Inevitably you’ll see only your flaws and the grand catastrophes caused by your actions, and question if you have any worth. 

Then you lose touch with reality by obsessing about potential solutions to your social problems and pulling your hair out when they fail. Slowly your perceptions get distorted, your sense of normalcy declines and all you can do is charge forward like a battering ram.

Then you realize the mistakes you made, real event and false memory close in on you and now you have another problem on your hands. One that makes you feel deep, deep shame. And now you have real proof of it. 

Beyond any specific obsessions or compulsions, your relationship to the world becomes all about solving. There’s always an emergency and your mind is constantly trained on anxiety and solving. Years on years reinforce and ultimately centralize those neural pathways as the lens you view everything.

Post 81: ngl having ocd kinda feels like you have that guy that says "let's play devils advocate" in your head, but all. the. time

"let's say, hypothetically.."

Post 82: ocd is actual mental torture and i wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy
Content:
i just wish i could have one single day where i could relax and not feel guilty or anxious about something. it literally doesn’t stop. i don’t know how i’m supposed to deal with confession ocd anymore. if i confess, i get relief and it moves onto the next thing or finds new things to feel guilty about. if i don’t confess, i feel constant dull anxiety in the background and my mind fixates on different things i’ve done or thoughts that popped themselves into my head and switches between them like it’s spinning a fucking wheel every 10 minutes. i can’t take it anymore. 

when does it go away?? when does my mind stop screaming at me that i’m “hiding something” from my gf if i don’t confess each and every single one of the bad thoughts that have popped up in my head even though i don’t like them and they don’t align with my values or they’re just straight up intrusive? i’d give anything to be normal again and be able to brush off thoughts i don’t like or agree with and move on with my day instead of my mind fixating on them and making me feel like a horrible person even though i’m not.

the ONLY moments of calm i’ve been able to get lately is when me and my gf call and hang out but funny enough my confession ocd revolves around her and my brain being anxious about what she’d think of if she knew the kind of things that popped up in my head but for fucks sake she literally said that i shouldn’t tell her or anyone my intrusive thoughts and that i don’t have to confess to her!! so i’m trying to listen to her on that because i love her and i’m loyal and she’s genuinely the person i wanna spend my life with so i try to disregard any bad or intrusive thoughts i’ve had since i don’t feel like those represent me and i try to label them as intrusive

what do i do? even if i resist confessing i’m still not doing okay. it just feels like there’s no way out and i don’t wanna lose the love of my life over thoughts that just put themselves in my head whenever my actions and values are in the right direction :(

Post 83: Something my therapist said that has really helped me with intrusive thoughts and forgiving myself!
Content:
While we were talking about intrusive thoughts, she explained that my OCD has created pathways in my brain where it's completely normal for me to have intrusive thoughts. She said that instead of being stressed when having a sudden intrusive thought, say to yourself "I was expecting to have these intrusive thoughts, it's completely normal for me, I knew I would have one". Taking away that fear of having them will take away the stress and anxiety, making them easier to deal with. 

When regretting the past and feeling guilty, the best way to think is that at the time you didn't know how it would affect you later. I was feeling guilty about something I did when I was 13. She said, while are you bullying your 13 year old self? she needs love and support. Would you bully a 13 year old today if you found out they did what you did? No, so stop beating your 13 year old self and love her instead. Hug her and support her. 

I hope this helps someone dealing with these problems, it's really changed my perspective greatly.

Post 86: Managed to overcome a contamination obsession today, so proud 😊
Content:
During the night I had the most disgusting thought, contamination OCD, you don't want to know what it was. I wanted to wash my hands but I was already in bed and didn't want to get up to entertain my OCD. I got maybe like 2 hours of sleep and the obsession was still there in the morning when I woke up. 

At that point the compulsion idea became so long and demanding... disinfecting my phone, washing all the bed sheets and a loooong shower.

So I just said fuck it I'm not doing this crap. And I went to my PC to get back to doing my job again after 2 weeks of sick leave.

I knew that since I had touched a bunch of things since my obsession started, at some point everything would become contaminated at which point my OCD would either give up or I would go into a cleaning frenzy.

The morning was really hard, work was stressful, OCD was adding even more stress but I pushed through and managed to get through the day.

Now that I'm lying in bed calm af I feel a lot better about myself for doing the right thing. It inspires me to do more exposures in other areas.

Post 87: Anybody else pre-grieve their loved ones deaths? Even if they aren't dying?
Content:
I think I have some version of existential/dear of aging/death ocd and whenever something nostalgic and nice makes me think of my parents (music they played for breakfast while we were growing up, etc.) it throws me into an inconsolable panic attack/sobbing 

It feels like I'm grieving their death but they're still here and it's eating at all my joy and good memories and I can't make it stop

Post 88: I am so disappointed in my psychology teacher spreading harmful misconceptions about OCD.
Content:
I did a presentation about OCD and long story short, she said to the class “I feel like we all experience OCD to a certain degree. Raise your hand if you agree.”

More than half of the class raised their hands. I was so shocked and disappointed I said nothing. I just stood there in absolute disbelief.

She then proceeded to talk about how she had to have her closet color aligned or else it “bothered” her. That is NOT OCD. Then the class started talking about their stupid organizational habits.

She has said other questionable things in the past too. To spread misinformation like this is horrible.

No one has OCD “to a certain degree”. You either have it or you don’t. You will never ever feel the pain people with OCD have.

She said one of the most obvious and stupid misconceptions and it really upset me. She should know better than to say that.

Post 89: Thank you for existing.
Content:
I feel less alone with you.

Nobody around me seem to understand what its like to have ocd, even my therapist.

They don't know what its like to be bullied by their own minds.

you make me stronger, just knowing that there are people out there going through the same problems makes me less anxious.

Thank you.

Post 94: Why is the phrase “I let my intrusive thoughts win” all the sudden a thing?
Content:
These people obviously don’t understand what an intrusive thought is. Or how distressing they can be. 

My intrusive thoughts are like:
- A tree falling on my house and killing my dog while I’m at work. 
- Holding a fork/knife the wrong way, then tripping and it impaling me. 
- Accidentally running someone over in my car. 
- Getting shot up by some psycho at the mall. 
- Getting fired from my job because someone is conspiring against me. 

Not, “Oh hehe haha, I’m gonna play a prank on someone.”

Post 95: Having OCD is like having someone follow you everywhere telling you to do, think, and say wierd, inappropriate, uncomfortable, and unpleasant things that you REALLY don't want to do and if you refuse they zap you with a cattle prod and hit you in the head with a chair until you submit.

Post 96: None of it is real. Never has been. Never will be.
Content:
It’s all fake. All of it is false. Every negative thought, every intrusive thought, every panic every fear every anxiety every doubt every confusion every “genuine” feeling. No matter how real it’s not. All of it is fake. All of it is false. All of it. None of it is real. You have to tell and remind yourself that. No matter what. All of it is fake. None of it is real. none of the feelings are. None of it. Will always feel real and convincing just know that it isn’t. No matter what. Remind yourself. None of it is real. None of it. Tell yourself every day. Get to this point by breaking yourself out the loop. 

I’ve learned that whether or not we believe or are aware of it negative thoughts do have power and we attract what we fear by compulsively focusing on it. Danger is always real but fear is always a choice. We can’t control what happens in life or in the future, it’s part of where fear stems from. But we can control how we react to them. Acceptance is the root of healing. Accept what you fear may happen but also may not. Accept what you fear did happen and accept that you can’t change the past. Accept that you have no control over what you don’t know and learn to let go. It is possible as impossible as it seems and I am proof of that. Once I got healthier this post helps me stay that way by reminding me not to fall back into old habits that served me no purpose but pain and fear.

Post 100: I called out a company for using OCD incorrectly...
Content:
And it went great! I was super nervous that they would respond poorly but they listened to my concerns and made all the adjustments I recommended. Shoutout to Alegra Kastens (@obsessivelyeverafter on instagram) for providing a super useful script to use when correcting people who using OCD incorrectly.

Background for those interested:

I bought a bag of locally-made candy a few weeks ago & when I read the "Our Story" blurb on the back of the bag, they described themselves as "a bit OCD" since they make their candy in a very clean & organized way. I was immediately so disheartened & sad & it was just a huge reminder that people really don't understand OCD. They also had the same "Our Story" blurb using OCD incorrectly on their website.

I really wanted to bring it to their attention but I was worried about how they would respond & what I would even say to try to not be confrontational. Then I saw Alegra's post giving a script on what to say to those who use OCD incorrectly, & I decided to just go for it. I messaged them & mostly followed the script, but also mentioned that they need to change the wording on their website & packaging to stop contributing towards harmful stereotypes.

They finally responded this morning & they were extremely apologetic, & they changed the wording on their website & let me know that their next order & all future orders will have the packaging changed as well.

&#x200B;

Post 102: Do you also find yourself telling your brain to shut the fuck up?
Content:
Lately I’ve been getting so sick of this bs disorder I just want my brain to stfu, It’s the same intrusive thoughts over and over and I feel like I’m going nuts

Post 103: “Omg I’m so ocd”
Content:
Shut the fuck up.

Post 104: Someone with OCD posted a tiktok where she opened up about her intrusive racist thoughts.
Content:
A WOC duetted her and told her that she wouldn’t be having thoughts like that if she wasn’t racist, and that “there’s some things that shouldn’t be posted on the internet” as well as “this isn’t something to be proud of.”

Like…tf? 

And after looking at the WOC’s profile.. she’s definitely old enough and educated enough to know what OCD is. 

It infuriated the fuck out of me.

Post 105: Having OCD is like replying to every spam e-mail you receive and then wondering why you get overwhelmed.
Content:
On my first session my therapist explained to me that I should treat intrusive thoughts as if they were spam in my mailbox. I shouldn't open it immediately upon receiving it, and a quick glance should be enough to recognize and categorize it as such. I shouldn't bother to read the content in detail and should quickly dismiss it.

Although I found that analogy useful, it didn't address where my intrusive thoughts came from, or why I was getting those 'e-mails' on those particular subjects so often.

Now that I have overcome my OCD, I realize that I had not only been reading and believing the spam that I received, but I had been responding to them too, actively engaging with the sender on the subjects. And as everybody knows, that's about the worst thing you can do.

I hope this analogy works for you.

Post 106: Anyone else with ocd who isn’t clean/neat at all?
Content:
Since covid-19, there’s so many posts on here about their contamination ocd causing them to believe they were right about hand washing and sanitizing everything (not invalidating them, a ton of people with ocd have that). But I was just wondering if anyone else is as disorganized and un-clean as I am.

Post 107: Huge step for me today
Content:
Today, in my dining hall, I picked up a mug to get coffee and it wasn't cleaned well and instead of just setting down and walking out of the dinning hall without eating breakfast I put the dirty mug on the dirty dish conveyor belt and went back and got another mug.

This is huge for me since I really struggle with contamination, specifically food contamination to the point of it giving me an eating disorder (ARFID).

I realize to most people this is nothing but im really proud of myself.

Post 108: Psych gave me an OCD script and everyone with OCD needs to read it 
Content:
My psychologist gave me this script to read 4 times a day and it makes me emotional at the same time but gives me so much hope:



OCD Acceptance Script

I acknowledge that OCD is a part of my life, but it does not define who I am. It's one aspect of my complex self, and while it presents challenges, it also offers me unique insights into resilience, strength, and the human experience.

OCD brings with it intrusive thoughts, urges, and doubts. These can be intense and difficult to manage, but today, I choose to accept these experiences without judgment. Acceptance means seeing these thoughts for what they are: symptoms of my condition, not reflections of my character or desires.

I understand that fighting or resisting my OCD thoughts and feelings often gives them more power. Instead, I'll practice accepting their presence, knowing that acceptance is the first step in reducing their impact on my life. This doesn't mean I won't work to manage my OCD, but I will do so from a place of understanding and compassion, rather than fear or frustration.

With acceptance comes the willingness to seek help and support. I am open to therapy, to learning strategies like Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), and to connecting with others who share similar experiences. I know that by embracing evidence-based treatments and community support, I can live a fulfilling life, even with OCD.

I also accept that progress may be slow and non-linear. There will be good days and challenging ones. I commit to treating myself with kindness and patience, celebrating my victories, no matter how small, and forgiving myself when things don't go as planned.

I recognize the importance of focusing on what I value and love, allowing those things to guide my actions and decisions, rather than my fears or compulsions. My values are my compass, leading me toward a life of meaning, even amidst uncertainty.

Today, I pledge to practice self-compassion, to remind myself that I am doing my best, and to remember that I am not alone in this journey. There is hope, and there is help. By accepting my OCD, I take an important step towards empowerment and healing.

I am more than my OCD. I am capable, resilient, and worthy of a joyful, purposeful life. With acceptance as my foundation, I move forward with courage and hope.

Post 112: Reminder: Don’t solve the thoughts!
Content:
Hello! Just a little reminder to not solve the thoughts! Don’t try to get the right feeling, and then move on!

There are 2 ways you can go about this...

1. You solve the thought, then get another thought. Then you solve that one and get another. And so on...
Or...
2. You keep this thought and acknowledge that it’s there but you don’t engage in it. You’ll have this thought following you for a while until the OCD grows bored and moves on to a different thought.

If you keep trying to solve the thoughts, you’re telling your brain that this is important and in turn, your brain will continue to send you similar thoughts so you can keep solving them.

Your brain loves to solve things! But there are some things that you can’t or don’t even NEED to solve!

Even if you solve the thought, the next thought will bring you just as much anxiety, so the anxiety will be equal no matter what! Content doesn’t matter. Even when you feel like you’ve solved all the thoughts and there’s not a thought that your brain can come up with at the moment, your brain is actively trying to come up with something to bring you anxiety. Just keep whatever thought you have until it grows bored and moves on. That way, you’re telling your brain that this is not important.

Hope this helped!

Does anyone agree or relate? 

I feel like having OCD is like having your own twitter thread constantly going off in your head, telling you you’re a bad person for breathing in someone’s direction or some crazy theory about how your mom is gonna die if you don’t do XYZ. 

It’s like a those crazy arguments that happens in the comments and everything is a catastrophe.

Edit: thank you everyone for the comments xD. I’m glad this resonates with other people. Hang in there everyone! We’re in this together 💜

Post 115: Anyone else feel “sympathy” for inanimate objects?
Content:
This is something I’ve dealt w/ since I was a child (20F). If a bus is overcrowded, I feel “bad” for it. If we throw out food I get teary. Just awhile ago, I had a panic attack complete w/ tears because I remembered giving away a stuffed cat to charity and felt as though I hadn’t appreciated it enough. I know it’s extremely stupid and irrational, but I googled it and apparently this is fairly common w/ OCD? What do you guys think?

Post 116: I know you feel like it would be wrong for you to let go of whatever it is you are obsessing about. I know you feel like you won't be able to be happy until you "prove" that your fears aren't true. But you don't have to. You CAN move on.
Content:
Hey, you. Yes, I'm talking to you. You are probably scrolling through reddit searching for reassurance because of a "bad" thought or emotion you had, or because you are afraid you did something horrible, or because you think your identity as a person is hanging in the balance. You feel like you will have to sit here for the next multiple hours, ruminating and ruminating and ruminating, looking for answers that aren't there. You feel like you shouldn't do anything else until you figure this out.

But here's the truth: you are not obligated to figure this out. 

I know that your OCD is whispering in your ear, telling you that you MUST prove to yourself that you didn't think the "bad" thought "on purpose, or that it wasn't a "genuine" feeling, or that what you did wasn't actually bad. It is telling you that you are its prisoner, and that you are serving time for how horrible you are, that you can't leave the cage until your innocence is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 

But your OCD is lying to you.

You are NOT morally obligated to figure out the answers to these obsessive questions. There is nothing bad that will happen if you say, "maybe yes, maybe no" and move on with your day. Read a book. Go on a run. Do the dishes. Make a meal. Just do anything besides what your OCD is telling you that you must do. 

I know that you don't enjoy ruminating for hours. Nobody does. It is miserable. But there are things that you do enjoy. If you feel like you can't enjoy anything, there are certainly things to do that are a lot less miserable than obsessive rumination. 

And right now, you are probably going to say, "I know I don't enjoy ruminating, but I *need* to figure out whether this is true!"

Who says?

Your OCD does.

But the questions it wants you to ask yourself are irrelevant. There are outward things to do right now, for the good of yourself and for the good of others.

Ruminating doesn't make you happy. It doesn't help anyone else. Right now, tell yourself, "I don't know, and that's ok." Then go do somethin else. It will be very liberating.

Just curious, because I don't think it's talked about as much, but I feel like surely there are more of us who suffer from this than we talk about. Do you obsess over an intrusive thought for days/longer? Also have any of you discovered a med that helped? 

Post 118: Took my own trash out for the first time in YEARS!
Content:
I have OCD with really bad contamination fears and have been unable to take out my own trash for pretty much forever. This was fine with roommates, because they just handled it and the world worked smoothly, but living alone it would just all pile up for weeks until I could convince one of my friends to help me out. (Which was easy; my friends are very considerate about my mental conditions and were helping out once or twice a week before the pandemic.) 

Well, TODAY I TOOK MY OWN TRASH OUT! ALL BY MYSELF! 

I feel hopeful for the first time in a long time that I can actually un-fuck my house now! Hopefully in a month or two I'll be living in a clean place, that I'm able to maintain myself. That's the wish at least.

Content:
I used to read all the time and loved it. It’s been many years now since I could read a book because of my OCD. I’m trying because I love reading but I can’t focus, I have to re-read sentences or sometimes a page, I have to double check which page I’m on and if I missed one, I get the intrusive thought to read the last page which ruins the book lol. It takes so much energy and time. I argue with my OCD to not do these things which also just makes me lose focus. Do you have this problem and has it gotten better? It makes me sad because it’s like losing a whole world, you know?

Post 121: Met someone with OCD
Content:
Wow. Today was unexpected. I went to a dental office because I have to get a tooth pulled and the hygenist (much older than me) asked me about any mental disorders. I mentioned that I suffer from OCD and ADHD, and she halted me right there. She mentioned that she was just diagnosed with OCD after suffering from years of depression that likely started her OCD. I was in shock. Not because she had OCD but because I have NEVER met someone else who suffers from OCD. Since around the 4th grade (I think?), I have been diagnosed, and hearing her story was eye-opening. She suffers from contamination OCD, and while our OCD symptoms are different, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her because I know what she is going through. We exchanged "routines" with each other and laughed about how ridiculous OCD is. In my 24 years of living, I have never met a single soul who suffered from OCD. The purpose of my post is to highlight that we are NOT alone. That there are many of us out there continuing the fight. Continuing to fight the demon that is OCD. This is a prime example of "you can't judge a human by its cover." I am grateful for today.

Post 123: Target is selling another offensive OCD product

https://imgur.com/a/KSTN1nW

Target is selling this product on their website and in stores called a "Refreshed Traveler Safety Kit." In the online listing for the product it describes it as "Perfect for OCD" and "OCD Approved." I included a link with photos above.

I'm sick of OCD being used as a marketing gimmick. It just adds even more stigma to a disorder that is already so misunderstood, which makes it even harder for people to seek help and treatment. My OCD has caused so much suffering throughout my life that at times it has led me to contemplate suicide, and it took years for me to get help because I felt so much shame about my rituals. To me it's not a joke, and it's not funny. OCD ruins lives. After the whole "Obsessive Christmas Disorder" sweater ordeal from Target a few years back I'm honestly really disappointed to see this from them. They need to do better.

Content:
Am I the only one?

I quit every social media besides Reddit, but even on Reddit, I’m sometimes using throwaway accounts because I’m scared someone will find out who I am. 

When I used Snapchat, I always had to check if I had posted something to my story or sent something to someone multiple times. I checked and closed the app then I opened the app and repeated the same thing over and over and over again. I did the same with every other social media until I stopped using them unless, for some reason, necessary.

Does anyone else feel like they’re constantly talking to themselves, begging to be left alone?

Edit: after torturing myself for 2 years, I got help and meds and it changed my life. Yoga also really helps. Please take recovery seriously. There’s a whole life out there waiting for you to live it. I hope I see you all happy someday. Give it everything you’ve got. I really hope you see this as a sign that it gets better. Get well soon everyone 💙

Post 130: Husband told me I had "OCD Face"
Content:
I was diagnosed last November and my husband has been learning to navigate this with me, for which I have been so grateful. 

Yesterday he handed me a cup with my favorite latte in it. The problem was, it was a cup my brain insists is only for cold drinks, despite the fact that I bought it from The Coffee Bean and it's one of those insulated cups shaped like a wine glass. I thanked him and gingerly took the cup and he stopped and looked at me. He said, "You good?" I said, "Yes, why?" He said, "You've got OCD face."

I couldn't help but laugh. Even though I can't see it, it's fascinating to me that he can tell by my body language something's going on.

So here's a little appreciation post for partners of people with OCD. Thank you for weathering the storm with us.

Fuck you OCD, I'm taking back control! This war's not over until I WIN. And I can't lose if I just never fucking give up. 

To all those struggling, remember 3 things:

There is nothing wrong with seeking help, it doesn't make you "weak" . In fact it shows that you're not afraid to work like hell to battle your demons. 

 Progress is never quick or slow, progress is always in a DIRECTION.

You can't lose if you never give up.

All the best to everyone! And I'm so proud of myself and everyone who's fighting! cheers!

Post 136: 10 things I wish someone would have told me when I was struggling with OCD.
Content:
These 10 things helped me so much to overcome my OCD after years of pure HELL with this disorder ruining my life. I hope this helps you as well!

## 1. OCD is chronic

This means it is like having asthma or diabetes. You can get it under control and become recovered but, at the present time, there is no cure. It is a potential that will always be there in the background, even if it is no longer affecting your life.  The current thinking is that it is probably genetic in origin, and not within our current reach to treat at that level. The things you will have to do to treat it really control, and if you don’t learn to effectively make use of them throughout your life, you will run the risk of relapse. This means that if you don’t use the tools provided in cognitive/behavioral therapy or if you stop taking your medication (in most cases) you will soon find yourself hemmed in by symptoms once again.

## 2. Two of the main features of OCD are doubt and guilt

While it is not understood why this is so, these are considered hallmarks of the disorder.  Unless you understand these, you cannot understand OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as the “doubting disease.”  OCD can make a sufferer doubt even the most basic things about themselves, others, or the world they live in.  I have seen patients doubt their sexuality, their sanity, their perceptions, whether or not they are responsible for the safety of total strangers, the likelihood that they will become murderers, etc.  I have even seen patients have doubts about whether they were actually alive or not.  Doubt is one of the more maddening qualities of OCD.  It can override even the keenest intelligence.  It is a doubt that cannot be quenched.  It is doubt raised to the highest power. It is what causes sufferers to check things hundreds of times, or to ask endless questions of themselves or others.  Even when an answer is found, it may only stick for several minutes, only to slip away as if it was never there.  Only when sufferers recognize the futility of trying to resolve this doubt, can they begin to make progress.

The guilt is another excruciating part of the disorder. It is rather easy to make people with OCD feel guilty about most anything, as many of them already have a surplus of it.  They often feel responsible for things that no one would ever take upon themselves

## 3. Although you can resist performing a compulsion, you cannot refuse to think an obsessive thought

Obsessions are biochemically generated mental events that seem to resemble one’s own real thoughts, but aren’t.  One of my patients used to refer to them as “My synthetic thoughts.”  They are as counterfeit bills are to real ones, or as wax fruit is to real fruit.  As biochemical events, they cannot simply be shut off at will.  Studies in thought suppression have shown that the more you try to not think about something, the more you will end up thinking about it paradoxically. The real trick to dealing with obsessions I like to tell my patients is, “If you want to think about it less, think about it more.”  Neither can you run from or avoid the fears resulting from your obsessions.  Fear, too, originates in the mind, and in order to recover, it is important to accept that there is no escape.  Fears must be confronted.  People with OCD do not stay with the things they fear long enough to learn the truth–that is, that their fears are unjustified and that the anxiety would have gone away anyway on its own, without a compulsion or neutralizing activity.

## 4. Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy is the best form of treatment for OCD

Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best form of treatment for OCD.  OCD is believed to be a genetically-based problem with behavioral components, and not psychological in origin.  Ordinary talk therapy will, therefore, not be of much help. Reviewing past events in your life, or trying to figure out where your parents went wrong in raising you have never been shown to relieve the symptoms of OCD.  Other forms of behavioral treatment, such as relaxation training or thought-stopping (snapping a rubber band against your wrist and saying the word “Stop” to yourself when you get an obsessive thought) are likewise unhelpful.  The type of behavioral therapy shown to be most effective for OCD is known as Exposure and Response Prevention (E&RP).

E&RP consists of gradually confronting your fearful thoughts and situations while resisting the performing of compulsions.  The goal is to stay with whatever makes you anxious so that you will develop a tolerance for the thought or the situation, and learn that, if you take no protective measures, nothing at all will happen. People with OCD do not stay long enough in feared situations to learn the truth.  I try to get my patients to stay with fearful things to the point where a kind of fatigue with the subject sets in.  Our goal is to wear the thought out.  I tell them, “You cant be bored and scared at the same time.” Compulsions, too, are part of the system and must be eliminated for the recovery process to occur.  There are two things that tend to sustain compulsions.  One is that by doing them, the sufferer is only further convinced of the reality of their obsessions, and is then driven to do more compulsions.  The other is that habit also keeps some people doing compulsions, sometimes long after the point of doing them is forgotten. The cognitive component of CBT teaches you to question the probability of your fears actually coming true (always very low or practically nil), and to challenge their underlying logic (always irrational and sometimes even bizarre).

## 5. While medication is a help, it is not a complete treatment in itself

It is human nature to always want quick, easy, and simple solutions to life’s problems.  While everyone with OCD would like there to be a magical medicinal bullet to take away their symptoms, there really is no such thing at this time.  Meds are not the “perfect” treatment; however, they are a “pretty good” treatment.  Generally speaking, if you can get a reduction in your symptoms of from 60 to 70 percent, it is considered a good result.  Of course, there are always those few who can say that their symptoms were completely relieved by a particular drug.  They are the exception rather than the rule.  People are always asking me, “What is the best drug for OCD?”  My answer is, “The one that works best for you.”  I have a saying about meds:  “Everything works for somebody, but nothing works for everybody.”  Just because a particular drug worked for someone you know, does not mean that it will work for you.

Relying solely on meds most likely means that all your symptoms will not be relieved and that you will always be vulnerable to a substantial relapse if you discontinue them.  Discontinuation studies (where those who have only had meds agreed to give them up) have demonstrated extremely high rates of relapse.  This is because drugs are not a cure, but are rather a control.  Even where they are working well, when you stop taking them, your chemistry will soon revert (usually within a few weeks) to its former unhealthy state.  Meds are extremely useful as part of a comprehensive treatment together with CBT. They should, in fact, be regarded as a tool to help you to do therapy. They give you an edge by reducing levels of obsession and anxiety.  While those with mild OCD can frequently recover without the use of meds, the majority of sufferers will need them in order to be successful.  One unfortunate problem with meds is the stigma attached to them.  Having to use them does not mean that you are weaker than others, only that this is what your particular chemistry requires for you to be successful. You cant always fight your own brain chemistry unaided.  Using psychiatric drugs also does not mean that you are “crazy.” People with OCD are not crazy, delusional, or disoriented. When relieved of their symptoms, they are just as functional as anyone.

## 6. You cannot and should not depend upon the help of others to manage your anxiety or to get well

To begin with, and most obviously, you are always with you. If you come to depend upon others to manage your anxiety by reassuring you, answering your questions, touching things for you, or taking part in your rituals, what will you do when they are not around?  My guess is that you will likely be immobilized and helpless. The same is true if you only work on your therapy homework when others are nagging or reminding you. No one can want you to recover more than you do. If your motivation is so poor that you cannot get going on your own (assuming that you are not also suffering from an untreated case of depression), then you will have learned nothing about what it takes to recover from OCD.  As mentioned at the beginning, since OCD is chronic, you will have to learn to manage it throughout your life.  Since you can find yourself on your own at any point, unpredictably, you will always need to be fully independent in managing it.

## 7. The goal of any good treatment is to teach you to become your own therapist

In line with the last point, good Cognitive/Behavioral treatment should aim to give you the tools necessary to manage your symptoms effectively.  As therapy progresses, the responsibility for directing your treatment should gradually shift from your therapist to you.  Whereas the therapist may start out by giving you assignments designed to help you face and overcome your fears, you should eventually learn to spot difficult situations on your own and give yourself challenging homework to do.  This will then be a model for how you will need to handle things throughout your life.

## 8. You cannot rely upon your own intuition in deciding how to deal with OCD

In using your intuition to deal with what obsessions may be telling you, there is one thing you can always count on: it will always lead you in the wrong direction.  It is only natural to want to escape or avoid that which makes you fearful. It’s instinctive. It really amazes me how common this is. This may be fine when faced by a vicious dog or an angry mugger but, since the fear in OCD results from recurring thoughts inside your head, it cannot be escaped from. The momentary escape from fear that compulsions give fools people into relying upon them.  While compulsions start out as a solution, they soon become the main problem itself as they begin taking over your life. People with OCD never stay with what they fear long enough to find out that what they fear isn’t true. Only by doing the opposite of what instinct tells you will you be able to find this out.

## 9. Getting recovered takes time

How long does it take?  As long as is necessary for a given individual. Speaking from experience, I would say that the average uncomplicated case of OCD takes from about six to twelve months to be successfully completed. If symptoms are severe, if the person works at a slow pace, or if other problems are also present, it can take longer.  Also, some people need to work on the rehabilitation of their lives after the OCD is brought under control.  Long-term OCD can take a heavy toll on a persons ability to live.  It may have been a long time since they have socialized, held a job, or doing everyday household chores, etc. Some people have never done these things. Returning to these activities may add to the time it takes to finish treatment.

However long it takes, it is crucial to see the process through to the finish. There is no such thing as being “partially recovered.”  Those who believe they can take on only those symptoms they feel comfortable facing soon find themselves back at square one. Untreated symptoms have a way of expanding to fill the space left by those that have been relieved.  When explaining this to my patients, I liken it to getting surgery for cancer.  I ask them, “Would you want the surgeon to remove it all, or leave some of it behind?”  Or, put another way, it is not a game you can simply drop out of midway with your winnings and expect to keep them.

## 10. Relapse is a potential risk that must be guarded against

It has always been a favorite saying of mine that, “Getting well is 50 percent of the job, and staying well is the other 50 percent.”  We have actually come full-circle back to Point #1, which tells us that OCD is chronic. This tells us that although there is no cure, you can successfully recover and live a life no different from other people.  Once a person gets to the point of recovery, there are several things that must be observed if they are to stay that way.  As mentioned in Point #7, the goal of proper therapy is to teach people to become their own therapists.  It gives them the tools to accomplish this.  One of these tools is the knowledge that feared situations can no longer be avoided. The overall operating principle is that obsessions must therefore always be confronted immediately, and all compulsions must be resisted.  When people are seen to relapse, it is usually because they avoided an obsessive fear which then got out of hand because they went on to perform compulsions.  Another cause can be an individual believing that they were cured and stopping their medication without telling anyone.  Unfortunately, the brain doesn’t repair itself while on medications, and so when drugs are withdrawn, the chemistry reverts to its former dysfunctional state.  Finally, some people may have fully completed their treatment, but have neglected to tell their therapist about all of their symptoms, or else they did not go as far as they needed to in confronting and overcoming the things they did work on.  In pursuing treatment for OCD, it is vital to go the distance in tackling all of your symptoms, so as to be prepared for whatever you may encounter in the future.

It is vital to remember that no one is perfect, nor can anyone recover perfectly.  Even in well-maintained recoveries, people can occasionally slip up and forget what they are supposed to be doing.  Luckily, there is always another chance to re-expose yourself and so, rather than a person beating themselves up and putting themselves down, they can soon regain their balance if they immediately get back on track by turning again and facing that which is feared, and then not doing compulsions.

Finally, because health is the result of living in a state of balance, it is extremely important, post-therapy, to live a balanced life, with enough sleep, proper diet and exercise, social relationships, and productive work of some type.

I was walking into my building and I accidentally dropped my (nearly $6 Egg & cheese everything) bagel and it rolled out if it’s paper and onto the floor. I have pretty severe contamination OCD so normally I’d throw it away and cry. But this time for some reason my want for the bagel outweighed my worry about the germs. Even talking about it now I still don’t care! 
It tasted delicious btw

Post 141: People with Pure O. How is it like? How does a mental compulsion look like?
Content (Spoiler):
I've got pure O OCD. I repeat certain sentences in my head over and over again. I explain everything I do in my head. I count, I repeat, I explain. Also ruminating so bad. My head is never quiet. I search for things I did and try to see if I did something wrong in the past. Then I convince myself I did and need reassurance, which is bad, I know. An example of a compulsion of me is: when I shower and wash my penis I have to imagine a Pokemon in my head because I'm scared I might think of a family member while washing it and that means I touch myself because of them. So I close my eyes and imagine a Pokemon. Why a Pokemon, because its not a person, not sexual and innocent. This is 1 of the 100's compulsions Ive got. But Im curious to hear which compulsions you have and how they look like?

Post 143: How do you respond to people when they nonchalantly say "I'm OCD."
Content:
I recently met a new friend and she asked what I was up to this weekend. I mentioned that due to thunderstorms all weekend, I'll be staying home and cleaning up around the house. She responds, "do you like cleaning? I'm kinda OCD when it comes to keeping my house clean." I asked if she has been diagnosed with OCD and she responded no, but she deals with anxiety and depression. 

There is nothing more I can't stand is when people throw around mental illness like it's a joke. I want to call her out nicely about it, but I barely know her. How do you respond to this?

Post 144: I think groinal responses are one of the most fucked up symptoms of OCD
Content:
Like....you have no control over it. Maybe first it manifests from anxiety, then you get scared that you felt something, and that makes it even more worse and powerful. You try to rationalize it away (which is bad, of course, but who wouldn't?) and oh look at that! Now they're even stronger and more frequent. Now it feels like real arousal. Now it feels like maybe you really DO want it or have some sort of repressed attraction/fetish/whatever. You worry about it more, because how do you ignore such an upsetting sensation happening in your own body? Now there's a mental connection between the response and the trigger, no intrusive thoughts beforehand needed. And now whenever you're around the trigger you get the response because youre afraid of getting it. Your heart beats faster with anxiety and it gets hard to focus or breathe, which makes it feel even more like arousal. You hate it, you absolutely despise the feeling it gives you, you'd kill for it to go away (but what if you like it?)

And then the only way to get rid of it is to face the trigger, to ignore the sensation, no matter how powerful it is, no matter if it feels like you're about to fucking orgasm. For however long it takes to go away. Could be days. Could be weeks. You don't know! And all of this is against your will (but what if you're just lying to yourself.) It's fucking disgusting.

Post 147: My husband COOKED AND ATE his own dinner today. AND ATE IT.
Content:
My husband's OCD has him convince that any and all meats he cooks is poison. The meat is and always under cooked and if he eats it, he will get sick and die.

We are in personal therapy for our own mental problems and couples therapy so we can learn how to help each other.

Being married to someone with OCD is hard. I want to give in and let my husband do his rituals but I can't. So tonight was tough because I always cook because my cooking is "safe".

Before we met all he ate was pasta. He has gained 50 pounds since we met due to my hearty homecook meals.

But after food therapy our therapist he HAD to use our airfryer to cook a chicken leg AND eat part of it.

AND I couldn't eat it so he wouldn't have that safe feeling.

It only took 40 minutes for him to overcome his OCD and eat part of a chicken leg. And he didn't get sick and die so he made a SECOND ONE and ate it.

Now he wants to cook with me to learn more meat base dishes.

Major victory tonight in our household. Couldn't be more proud of my husband.

Post 150: Does anyone avoid desired activities out of fear that they will be contaminated or ruined by intrusive thoughts?
Content:
This morning I wanted to take my bike out and ride. The weather is clear. And I seldom get the time to. I wanted to up until I got a certain intrusive thought about an obsession not related to bike riding. At that point, j started to fear that if I go and ride my bike, that the experience and act of riding will be contaminated. I also feared that because of that thought being present in my mind and that I will be ruminating, that I will not enjoy riding my bike and that the entire ride will be a waste of time. Even though this may sound irrational, fhe feelings are intensely real. As real as it gets. Has anyone e experienced this before, and if so what did you do to overcome it?

Post 153: Just because you dont have the same compulsions and obsessions as other people doesn't mean you don't have OCD.
Content:
I get worried about this sometimes. Hearing other people talk about their OCD and their rituals and intrusive thoughts and it made me worried that I might not have OCD because some of these things I don't do or don't think. But logically speaking I know I have OCD and it doesn't have to match with anybody else's. 

Having fears that you might not actually have/are just faking OCD is actually a very common intrusive thought.  The thing is, OCD tends to target the things that you care about the most. For instance I have ROCD (relationship) because I care a lot about my relationship so I tend to obsess over it/relationships as a whole. I also do have various physical ritual behaviors and number things that are typical with people with OCD. I sometimes get worried because I hear people talk about how they'll constantly check locks to make sure they're closed and things like that and I get worried because I don't do that so I worry I might not have OCD.  In reality though, I honestly don't care about whether or not my doors are locked. I feel safe in my home and live in a low crime area so I almost never lock doors of any kind. Which isn't to say that rationality is a cure for OCD and me thinking rationally prevents me from doing that. After all, OCD thoughts are by nature irrational and have very little foundation in logic. 

What I'm getting at is that if you don't care about something then your OCD is unlikely to target that specific thing. If you don't care about locks, your OCD probably won't make you check them constantly, if you hate your family then you're unlikely to have intrusive thoughts regarding their harm, etc. 

And as for physical rituals go, just because a physical ritual works for someone else doesn't mean it will for you. We all have different rituals for different purposes. Maybe something that makes my hands "feel even" might not work the same for someone else and they have to to a different thing, or maybe they have a different "number" as you, etc.  When you worry about things like this it becomes another obsession and follows the same patterns as the rest.

Post 154: This thing my therapist said about dwelling on my thoughts will stick with me forever
Content:
“Put your hands right next to each other, your hands represent your thoughts. Now cover your face with them, can you see anything, can you focus on what you’re doing? No because your thoughts are blocking your point of view. 

Now move them away from your face by extending your arms. They are still there but now you can see and focus on what you are doing. 

After a while your arms will get tired so you will put your hands down. Your hands are still connected to you even though you don’t see them. Just like your hands your thoughts will never go away nor you can make them, just accept that they are there and let them go and your mind will let them go.”

I don’t know how well I could tell you or if anyone can relate but it helped me and I just wanted to share, hope it helps someone else too

Post 156: I realized recently that the average person doesn't think about cross-contamination at all
Content:
One of the ways I try to reason with my contamination OCD is "normal people do this all the time and are fine". Doesn't always work, but for some small things (like placing an 'outside' item on my bed) it helps a little.

So for a while I've been trying to figure out what, for most people, is the line they draw when it comes to cross contamination. I've been trying to base changing my habits off of "well, normal people still probably get weird about this thing..."

But the other day I FINALLY realized, normal people straight up don't think about contamination... at all. For most people, washing hands and showering your body is enough to feel clean. People don't feel tense sitting on a couch they sat in earlier in their 'outside' clothes. There is no line because contamination is an afterthought to most people.

I really hope one day I can live like that. It sounds so freaking nice😭
To not think about contamination at all except for hand washing and showering??? I really hope I can live like that one day and recover from this OCD. Thats all

No you don't. Every night, convincing yourself you're the equivalent of Hitler because of your thoughts and worries/past actions.

Blaming myself for a murder happening or someone going missing because I DIDN'T FLICK THAT LIGHT SWITCH. 
Convinced you're going crazy at every corner...

So no. You don't want this illness. It's not just "Being tidy" and you shouldn't be jealous of your friend for having it (she was talking about her friend who had it). 

Honestly. This world disgusts me more and more each day.

Post 160: Meditation WORKS, try this:
Content:
I've been doing an hour or two of meditation a day and find it to be one of the most effective means of treating OCD. I think the reason more people don't recommend it is because there is a lot of misinformation surrounding the practice.

Meditation does not try to eliminate your thoughts or even relax or calm you. Meditation trains your attention and awareness to increase your overall cognitive ability. With OCD, much of the issue is not your thoughts or obsessions themselves, but rather the attention that you give them.

To train your attention and awareness all you must  do is sit and keep track of the sensations around you and then focus your attention on the sensation of your breath. You will be fighting against distractions and invasive thoughts, but as long as you keep the right intent, you can return to your breath.

In time this practice will give you more active control of your attention in all areas of your life. Intrusive thoughts will not have nearly as much of an effect on you and you will be able to live life with vastly more clarity and mental ability.

They say having OCD is like having a handicap.  

Except, one of the hardest parts about it, is other people can't see this handicap.  You suffer alone.  On the inside.

If you were blind, or deaf, or physically disabled, people would go out of their way to open the door, help you, give you space, feel sympathy, whatever you need.  But as it is, if you're at all like me, you've gotten great at hiding it.  And they don't know.  

Nobody notices.  They don't know you are suffering on the inside.  They don't understand the constant battle going on in your mind.  

They might even resent you, or dislike you, because your OCD has made you do strange things around them.  And they blame you.  Which compounds the suffering.

Sending hugs to everyone today who is out there suffering alone.  You are not alone.  There are millions of us out there like you.  

It is your burden, it is also your super power and your opportunity.  Because of this extremely unique gift you've been given, you are better able to understand the pain and suffering of others.  

*Big hugs* to the OCD pilgrims out there today suffering alone.  Just remember, you are not alone.

Post 166: Guys!!!!!! I am so so proud of myself!! After over a year of not taking my reflux meds due to OCD making me terrified of the meds, I finally did it!!!
Content:
I’m on omeprazole (40mg in the morning and 40mg at night) because I have pretty bad GERD. It really messes my life up when it’s not under control. I can’t exercise and I can’t eat most food. 

For over a year I’ve been terrified of my meds because my OCD brain said that they’d make me sick (I’m extremely emetophobic)

But tonight, I said fuck it and took them before I could think too much!!

Still extremely anxious because I’ve gone directly against my magical thinking- but goddamn I’m so so proud of myself, dudes!!!!

The thing that pushed me is how much I missed exercise. My reflux has been especially bad since October- and I’ve not been able to run at all or do much exercise since then. I miss it so much. I’m not even super fit- nor was I ever- but exercise makes me feel so good about myself. Plus- I might be joining the volleyball team through my school, and I cannot play if my reflux is as bad as it is now.

So so proud rn :•]

Post 169: You ever look back to your childhood and think "ohhhh that was OCD"?
Content:
Growing up I had two sleep-based obsessions: I could NOT sleep if I was hungry, and I was terrified of wetting the bed.

I ended up creating a ritual every night to manage these obsessions. When I was ready for bed, I would pee, drink a glass of milk, and then wait exactly 5 minutes before peeing once more. Only then could I sleep.

I knew it wasn't necessarily normal but didn't connect the dots until much later in life when I started suspecting I had OCD.

Post 170: i feel like ocd has been tiktokified
Content:
i’ve seen so many posts about people having “intrusive thoughts” to dye their hair and people talking about how other people think it’s good to have ocd cause it motivates you to clean or that ocd is just being neat and organized. i feel like it’s always been misunderstood but tiktok takes a mental health thing and tiktokifies it in a way, like with depression and adhd.

intrusive thoughts aren’t quirky desires like wanting to dye your hair blue. they’re gross, weird, gorey, and uncomfortable. ocd doesn’t motivate you to clean, it makes you feel uncomfortable and dirty. i’m sick of people on tiktok taking something like adhd or ocd and making it some quirky little thing that is just so fun.

i haven’t been diagnosed yet but i suspect i have it cause i have symptoms that are interfering with my day to day life. i brought it up to my therapist recently and we’ll continue to discuss it so i’ll update you guys maybe.

Post 173: Why OCD hasn’t had the same wave of TikTok self diagnosis that other mental illnesses have
Content (Spoiler):
I’ve been thinking about this a lot in light of people diagnosing themselves with ADHD, ASD, BPD, and DID based on TikTok content. As someone with what a psychiatrist called “the most clear cut case of ADHD I’ve ever seen”, it annoys me to see all these cute videos about quirky traits being attributed to ADHD. People without ADHD see these and think “I do this so maybe I have it!” and they completely gloss over the debilitating nature of living with ADHD.

I’m glad OCD hasn’t gotten the same cutesy spin as other mental illnesses, but it got me wondering why that is. And I think it’s because, with the ego-dystonic and logic-defying nature of this  illness, there’s really nothing relatable about it if you don’t have it. While some traits of ADHD, ASD, BPD, and DID can be relatable to a broader audience, nothing about being worried you’re a pedophile, or being terrified you’ll cheat on your partner when you have no intention to, or having intrusive thoughts about harming others is something people can relate to if they don’t experience it. Nor would they want to. 

It can feel really lonely at times because very few people understand, but it also means there aren’t a wave of self-diagnosed-from-TikTok folks clogging up access to services, so I see it as a good thing. 

Thoughts?

Post 174: How on earth do people wear shoes in the house?
Content:
Seriously, at least 95% of friends that I’ve had wear shoes in the house and so do their families. I can’t fathom how people do it, even people without OCD. Is it only common in the US? When you’re outside, you could’ve stepped in literally fucking ANYTHING. And people are just like, “yeah let me walk through the house with my grimy ass shoes. Even though my bare feet will be touching the floor sooner or later, there’s no issue.”

Edit: I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SLIPPERS/SHOES THAT ARE ONLY WORN AT HOME! I wear slippers in the house myself, I'm asking why people wear the same shoes that they wear outdoors inside the house.

I have been dealing with OCD since I was 7/8 years old. I had never gotten help while living with my parents, and now as an adult I sought help on my own.

I have been on medication for depression/anxiety for over a year now, and last month I changed psychiatrists and the new one ordered my medication dosage to be increased. So last week I saw her again and she prescribed me Ritalin, which I started taking on Tuesday.

Guys.
OMG

Today i waked up, took my meds and started my day wayy early than i'm used to (i never have energy to get up before 10), clead up all my house, that has been a mess for some time.
Then, i left to go to work and it happened.
I stepped "wrong" into the crosswalk and I FELT NO ANXIETY OR FRUSTRATION.

I was shocked for a moment and I started stepping on everything I could. All the lines in the floor, cracks in the concrete, shadows and imaginary lines. I felt like a kid and almost cried.

I feel like a huge weight had been lifted off of me. I've never felt this way. It's like I'm rediscovering the world with different eyes. I can walk looking forward and not down for the first time in my life.

Content:
When it comes to OCD people think handwashing, need for tidiness, or arranging things in a certain order.

I had none of that. 

I struggle with keeping my room clean and that was also the case as a child who’s room and backpack and locker was always messy. (Didn’t help that the principal shamed me for it. Advice to adults: shame rarely makes things better).

Anyway…

I think I did compulsive praying back then too.

I would always *have to recite* a certain ad. It’s like a 5 second thing that has been added to any advertisement of medications and at the end they say the same thing that tells you that, if you have questions, you need to ask your pharmacists or something like that. 

I always had to recite that. 

If I would dig deeper I would probably find more things. 

I also had the “I have to hold my breath thing until I’m at a certain place” but I think that’s so common and I’m not sure if it’s ocd.

Post 180: i feel like people don't get just how damaging ocd is
Content:
this has kinda been on my mind for a few days. 

when i tell people about my ocd, there's sort of this unspoken feeling of 'well, clearly that's illogical, get over it'. i'm not sure if other people can feel it, but it just makes me so sad.

rarely do i ever speak with people who understand that ocd literally makes you feel, constantly, a horrific sense of doom. everything feels so completely out of your control. it's probably been the most damaging mental health issue ive ever had, and has caused more relationship issues than anything else in my life.

most discussions i see about ocd are from the perspective of people who have never had it. that's part of why i appreciate this subreddit so much- i felt really alone for a long time. it's such an isolating experience, but seeing you all reminds me that i'm not alone in this.

even still, those years feeling like i was alone have done nearly irreparable damage to me psychologically and it really sucks. this disorder really does try and take away all your control.
