Hello, I‚Äôve read a lot of posts recently about folks missing classes and feeling too anxious to come back. Don‚Äôt worry. We would much rather you come back to our classes than continue to miss. We teach because we care about you individually. We care about what‚Äôs going on in your lives. I know it‚Äôs easy to see professors as these omnipresent overlords but know that we are human and we have definitely been in your position before. Please feel better and know that you are always welcome back into class. Just shoot us an email and let us know what‚Äôs up so we can help you make up the work you missed.


Post 2: My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.
Content:
It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: "Sorry I have to pull over." I reply: "Ok is everything alright?." He says "Sorry having a panic attack."

I remained calm and told him, "Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time."

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: "I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone."

&#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers

Post 5: Do you ever stay up late cause it‚Äôs your time to just exist?
Content:
If I go to sleep then the next day is gonna come so much faster, but if I stay up late I can just exist and not have to deal with the world and I can just be in my little bubble. I don‚Äôt have to live, I can just exist, just be. Everything is quiet and calm and I have no responsibilities and nothing that I HAVE to do besides exist. The next day will come by so fast if I sleep and I‚Äôll miss out on this moment of nothingness, and I‚Äôm just not ready to deal with the next day yet, I just need a few more hours of just being.

Post 12: Can we just have a round of applause for restaurants that post their menus online
Content:
It's sooooo much easier going to a restaurant/caf√©/fast food joint/whatever (for the first time) when you can check out the contents and prices of their menus beforehand, and this especially comes in handy to my socially anxious peeps. Sometimes I see a restaurant that looks promising, but I chicken out because I like to have my order locked and loaded before even setting foot at the place.

Also, this doubles as a plea to all restaurants- if you didn't alreday do it, I'M BEGGING YOU please post your menus online, whether on your website, your IG story highlights, or in an album on Facebook.

Post 14: At the end of my first ever session my therapist said something I‚Äôll never forget
Content:
EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I‚Äôm in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much üíï

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‚Äòis it a big deal for you?‚Äô I said, ‚Äòyes, massively‚Äô and she just simply replied ‚Äòwell then it‚Äôs a big deal...‚Äô, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it‚Äôs me that matters and someone else not thinking it‚Äôs serious does NOT invalidate that. I‚Äôm always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won‚Äôt judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it‚Äôs a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they‚Äôre all worth fixing guys, don‚Äôt ever forget that xx

Post 15: I once asked my psychiatrist why am I tired all the time and he took out his phone, turned on the torch and said to me, ‚ÄúIf I leave the torch on, it will drain the energy of the phone. That‚Äôs what anxiety does to you and that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt have any energy left for other things.‚Äù

Post 19: It's so frustrating when society wants to be all "mental health awareness" but when it comes to the actual symptoms of anxiety and other mental illnesses or being slightly low functioning, you're suddenly condemned for showing them
Content:
The company that I worked for: "Hey it's mental health week! Here is a pdf on how to treat people with kindness and always be mindful of others and what they might go through!"

The same company after mental health week: "Oh what? You're overwhelmed with stress and you're showing side effects of the workload you're carrying while panicking and taking a breather? Meet me at the office after work because this behaviour is unacceptable and unprofessional compared to your neurotypical co-workers that can carry the job normally."

EDIT: holy shit, didn't expect this to get 2k+ upvotes in less than a day. Thanks guys for the rewards, I don't know how reddit rewards work but thanks!

I feel less alone when it comes to this subject but at the same time it's sad and upsetting to know that this problem is everywhere and the mental health when it comes to society has a loooooooong way till it's normalised like a physical illness. Sending my support to you guys and I hope the world can eventually treat you better without being gaslit <3

Post 20: Anyone else feel like they are wasting their life by focusing on just having the day be over - but every day?
Content:
Every day I have this anxiety about work, and every day I tel myself ‚Äúwell it‚Äôll be over at 5pm‚Äù and then I have the evening but I go to bed very early because I‚Äôm tired of being anxious all day and then do it all over again in the morning. I feel like I‚Äôve lost months of time like this. I don‚Äôt want to let my life disappear into just waiting for the days to be over.

Post 21: Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.
Content:
Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from "beating" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

All credit for this tip goes to u/TomClinPsy who posted it elsewhere but it was removed for some reason. Luckily I had screenshot it because it felt so profound to me.

Post 22: Does anyone else constantly feel like they‚Äôve done something wrong after social interactions?
Content:
Basically the title. I constantly feel like I‚Äôve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don‚Äôt have a bad relationship with any of them. I don‚Äôt consider myself anti social. I‚Äôve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it‚Äôs all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I‚Äôve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they‚Äôll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it, but for some reason I can‚Äôt shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?

EDIT:  I never expected this post to get the response that it did. I want to reply to everyone, but don‚Äôt want to be a broken record either. I‚Äôm sorry you all are suffering with this as well and I hope we all find some relief someday. It really helps me to know I‚Äôm not alone in these feelings. I hope knowing you‚Äôre not alone brings you some relief as well. And I‚Äôm nobody special, but if anyone ever needs to talk or share experiences I‚Äôm here.

This often comes over me and I stress so much that I‚Äôll spend so many years feeling so negative and anxious, only to waste my life doing so and not able to live my life to the full. It sounds dumb I know but I imagine being old and looking back at what should have been some of the best years of my life which were actually tainted.

EDIT: Thank you so much for all your comments/upvotes/awards. I feel a lot better knowing I‚Äôm not alone, although I wouldn‚Äôt wish this feeling on anyone else! We can do this guys!

Post 25: I don‚Äôt think most people understand how exhausting the physical symptoms of anxiety are
Content:
There‚Äôs a lot of physical symptoms such as shaking, fidgeting, heavy breathing, rapid breathing, getting extremely overheated, rapid heartbeat, stomach pain, nausea, bathroom issues, etc. I think most people just assume it‚Äôs completely internal, but man it can be exhausting. Especially when you‚Äôre in an anxiety-inducing situation that is lengthy, such as a social outing. It can really take a toll on your energy and productivity, even the next day.

Post 26: Anyone else more anxious about COVID restrictions being lifted than they were about them being implemented?
Content:
I have adapted really well to the social isolation and working from home thing. I have a great routine now (way more balance with work/life/health than I did pre-covid) and love having more time to spend with my pets, reading & contemplating. All the zoom meetings for work and maybe 1-2 virtual ‚Äúcatch ups‚Äù with friends every week are adequate for me socially. 

However when I think about how I‚Äôll have to go back to my typical 8-5 grind with a 2 hour commute on top of those hours, I feel super anxious. Anybody else in a similar boat? 

Note I‚Äôm not saying I hope covid continues to thrive, I know it has had a severely negative impact on many people. I am just anxious at the thought of returning to what was my ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù that I hated.

Post 27: I don't think a lot of people realise how much of a disability anxiety can be.
Content:
Confidence is 75% of the battle in life. Jobs, partners, friends, etc. it's all down to being confident. You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. 

With anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person.

It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle. 

Constant anxiety is so incredibly unhealthy for your psyche yet people without anxiety often can't understand this. Instead we appear a bit shy, maybe even lazy, but they don't know what it feels like to have this affliction

Post 28: I actually did it. Found an amazing new job in a much better city, faced my boss to quit my current job. Found a house, turned on utilities, and scheduled movers.
Content:
I'm not going to lie. It was hell. Every step of it was panic attacks, fear, and a rollercoaster of emotions. But I did it. And now I have such a massive feeling of relief. It really made clear that the only way to deal with things is literally just to face them head on. I wasn't going to have this amazing new house or job unless I pushed myself through. Period. 

If you're going through something and its hard to follow through, or hard to even start. Just try and think about the end goal, not the process. It doesnt make it easy. But it gives you just enough motivation to keep taking one more small step at a time. As Dory says, "just keep swimming".

Post 29: I‚Äôm an italian OCD and anxiety sufferer, and I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs going to be okay.
Content:
I know you probably don‚Äôt believe me, but it WILL get better and easier. I know it sounds scary when governments start to put out all of those limitations and lockdowns, but it‚Äôs for the better. 

If you‚Äôre starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you‚Äôll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I‚Äôm trying to do the splits, I‚Äôm reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

We have the amazing power of adaptation. Every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you‚Äôll see how strong you are with them. Sometimes I imagine COVID-19 as the boss level of anxiety, and it gets me super pumped lol. It makes me want to kick its ass so much.

It‚Äôs a wild ride but if us italians are riding it out, you‚Äôll ride it out as well!
Sending you all a giant hug. We‚Äôre in this shit together.

And please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. And that means check only what YOU as a citizen need to do. Numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it‚Äôs a pain that you really don‚Äôt need in your everyday life. If it‚Äôs impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.

EDIT: thank you so much for the awards, I really never thought this would blow up. There are so many comments, I‚Äôll try my best to answer to the most. But as for all the compliments, THANK YOU!! You are all really sweet. You‚Äôve joined the fight with us, you are not alone :).

Post 31: Healthy people talk about anxiety as if it‚Äôs something you can control...
Content:
‚ÄúJust breathe!‚Äù ‚ÄúThink positively.‚Äù ‚ÄúWorrying only makes you suffer twice.‚Äù Ya know, those kinds of saying. 

I wish it was that easy. If I could control it, it wouldn‚Äôt be called an illness. 

This morning I woke up feeling perfectly fine (which is rare), was sitting on my couch reading then all of the sudden, my heart started beating so fast for no fucking reason, and I started hyperventilating. It took like 2 hours to collect myself and I had no idea what that whole episode was about.

So don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs something I can control, I had a panic attack while thinking about literally nothing.

Edit: Thank you to all the healthy people that replied to this post saying: ‚ÄúWe mean well‚Äù. I get that. But it‚Äôs not helpful at all, when we‚Äôre venting and your first reaction is defensiveness. Sometimes all we want is to be heard. I know this is irrational, but jumping in with a cure sometimes isn‚Äôt the best route. 

Also, to all my GAD fellows, thanks for reading & understanding.

Post 32: I took a blanket and a hot water bottle out to a homeless man sleeping under the stairs on my apartment building. I'm shaking and feel faint but am proud I did it.
Content:
It's about 2 degrees Celsius at night where I live right now, for context. As I arrived home late this evening I saw a homeless man sleeping under some building insulation fabric in the outdoor stairwell of my apartment building. 

As soon as I got inside my nice toasty apartment I couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. 

Barely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.

Im back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all.

I feel I'm making a big deal out of literally just being a decent human, but it was a big deal for me and my anxiety so I wanted to share the success.

Post 33: Anyone feels like they live more in their head than in real life?
Content:
So, I was wondering, anyone feel like this? 
I think I spend more time in my one head than in the real life. I constantly fantasise and I take refuge in books and TV shows. 
I'm very emphatic too, and I usually imagen how is does the characters feels. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know what is real life and what isn‚Äôt. But I took comfort in imaginary worlds and usually overindulge in this feelings and worlds. 

I feel like life is extremely unpleasant more of the time. When I was younger this could had been seen as "daydreaming" but I‚Äôm almost 22 years old now‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt know if this is still a good thing.

Edit: Hey! I'm so so happy for all the support in the comments. I just wanted to say thank you to you all! This has been quite emotional for me, being able to see myself in others and the similar things we all live trough. Thank you all for being so amazing!

Post 35: Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are ‚Äúwasting‚Äù it doing nothing?
Content:
I have been like this for years but I feel it‚Äôs been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I‚Äôve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don‚Äôt have plans, I‚Äôm still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it‚Äôs beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I‚Äôm off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it‚Äôs too hot, I don‚Äôt want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I‚Äôm relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I‚Äôve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

*Edit to add, I‚Äôm also more introverted so making plans with friends can be exhausting but I do it and have fun every time. Recently all my weekends have been jam packed with plans so I wouldn‚Äôt feel like this but apparently it doesn‚Äôt work that way!

Post 36: There are people out there who don't have anxiety
Content:
Isn't it just such a wild thought that there are people out there who just live their lives? They're not constantly worrying or feeling overwhelmed. They don't have panic attacks. They're able to do whatever they feel like doing! Like, it's so insane to me there are people who can travel the world, or even just function in their day to day lives.

I've only ever known life with anxiety. Although I guess that's better than living a "normal" life then developing severe anxiety, I just wish I could have known what it felt to be fearless at some point.

EDIT: I was not expecting this much of a response from everyone, I am very surprised! I am a little overwhelmed by all the comments, so I'm sorry if I don't respond to you but I am reading them! Thank you so much everyone. You are all lovely people, wishing you all the best!

Post 37: anyone else get surprised when people genuinely like you and want to spend time with you?
Content:
i almost always doubt someones intentions when they are talking to me. im always worried they think im weird or annoying, and that theyd rather be someplace else. and i almost always think when someone is being nice to me, that they are not being sincere. or when they are telling me something about themselves, they are lying to see if im "stupid enough to believe it" or something. i know its dumb and irrational. does anyone know how to let go of this doubtfulness, because im sick and tired of having nearly every conversation be like this. i just want to be able to socialise properly lol. to be honest i think this is less a social anxiety issue and more a self esteem issue but they kinda go hand in hand so

Post 38: Always afraid of 'getting in trouble' - anyone else?
Content:
I've always been nervous about 'getting in trouble' - I'm not sure I can even put words to it exactly.  As a kid it made sense, I had super strict parents, but it's followed me into my adult life.  Like at work, I'm always anxious I'm going to get 'in trouble'.  

And when I self talk that it doesn't even make sense - like who gives a fuck?  Losing my job would suck but I've never lost a job and my boss says I'm doing well.  And yet I find myself always looking over my shoulder and feeling guilt and anxiety building if anything is going wrong or if I slack off a bit after getting work done.

I wish I could shake the tendency but I just can't seem to.  Anyone else feel this?

Post 42: Does anyone feel depressed that their anxiety has kept them from experiencing major parts of a "normal" life?
Content:
I barely went out with friends when I was in high school. Always heard about my friends going out to parties, but I never went to one myself. In university, I avoided going out with friends, and mostly kept to myself. At the time, I didn't realize I had anxiety. But now, when I look back, knowing that I had anxiety and depression, it makes me really sad that I missed out on socializing and parties. Even though deep down I feel like I would have felt uncomfortable at them anyways. Not sure if that makes sense or not. It's sort of feeling like I wish I could have enjoyed them even though the reality is that I probably wouldn't have enjoyed them much even if I had had the opportunity to socialize more.

I went back to pessimism and expecting the worst after a few days of not hearing back, but I did today, and they offered me the job!!!!! Higher pay, almost double the PTO, amazing benefits... I‚ÄôM JUST SO EXCITED!!!! 

I know on my first day I‚Äôm gonna have massive anxiety and second guess everything and wish I stayed in my comfort zone but I don‚Äôt even care because this just proves to me that if I push through those nasty feelings I really can do anything!!

Thank you so so so much to everyone that gave such kind words of support and encouragement. This has been a HUGE life changing step for me and it‚Äôs amazing to be able to share it with all of y‚Äôall.

Edit: I promise I‚Äôm done bragging on myself after this but I just negotiated a (slightly, not by much but still!) higher salary as well! I‚Äôm over the moon, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm me and I did this haha.

Content:
I'm really socially anxious and thinking about posting this is making it hard to breath and making me shake but I'm trying to get better and if you're reading this then it means I am taking a small step towards my goal and this is my first post so I'm even more anxious. I'm trying so hard from crying and deleting this post. I've probably wrote 50 different sentences and deleted them thinking it's not good enough and that people would be upset. I really don't want to but I got to try. It's been 15-20 minuets since I started to type all of this  and I'm really  scared on posting it. Please don't be too hard on me... I'm sorry for  the mess of the post  but if you're reading this it means I did it and thank you for reading.

Post 47: anyone else get anxiety attacks from memories of bad/cringy/nasty stuff from the past?
Content:
I feel like I've become a shit ton better as a person, but there are those nights that make me relive all those bad moments and I beat myself up so much that I get seriously messed up. 

What I wouldn't give to go back and do it all over the right way again..That way, I might've made better friends who would've lasted through maybe?

Or maybe these experiences, they've made me better as a person? They've shaped me? I dont know at this point.

edit - didn't think so many people struggled w this. Awful stuff, but we learn from them and grow as people? take care, all of you, xx

Post 48: Does anyone else get anxious when being yelled at, or just hearing someone raise their voice?
Content:
I've noticed here recently that my chest gets tight and I can hardly breathe when being yelled at or hearing someone raise their voice in general. Does anyone have a way to calm themselves when this happens?

Post 49: Does anyone else get angry at themself for not being the person they want to be because of their anxiety?
Content:
As the title of the post suggests, I get angry at myself for not being able to speak up when I should, say things in meetings when I should (for fear of being judged, looking stupid etc). It's like I have a real version of myself in my head that I want to be and I get annoyed at the anxious, insecure version of myself that I feel I am forced to show to the world because of my anxiety. Does anyone else have this feeling? I beat myself up daily for not feeling able to be there person I want to be particularly in a work context as often I feel I can't speak out in meetings in particular or when someone says something I disagree with. On the occasions where I do speak out I fear it comes across as aggression. It's a daily battle I feel I struggle to win.

Post 50: Does anyone else get anxious after interacting with people, because you felt maybe you acted weird/said something wrong
Content:
I have this really annoying habit that every time I hang out with friends / have talks with people, afterwards i start obsessing over every word that came out of my mouth. "Maybe i shouldn't have said that" "Maybe i should have reacted differently"... It's so tiring and it always lasts at least the next day and makes me incredibly anxious. I just want to relax and not feel like I'm a total idiot by just interacting with others. I try to constantly fight it by telling myself i did nothing wrong, but the moment i don't fight it, i get back on the anxiety circle. 
 
Can anyone relate? 

And if anyone has any helpful tips, that'd be appreciated!

Post 51: I did something
Content:
I showered. First time in 3 weeks. I scrubbed, lotioned, brushed and flossed. A milestone.

This is not a throwaway account. It's my only account. I try to hold others up. Not karma farming.

Just proud/happy I got this far.

Content:
so I just got my ideal job offer and I'm really happy but also finals are this week and I'm scared I will fail 1 or 4 of my classes as a result and I don't know why I can't just be happy for once and accept that maybe nice things can happen to me

I think that by always expecting the worst I make the best less likely to happen. Trying to fix it...

Post 56: I lost my companion of 18 years. People don‚Äôt understand how important a pet can be for people with anxiety/mental illness.
Content:
I adopted my cat as a kitten when I was in grad school. I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

I have a great support system and a wonderful fianc√©. She was with me at the vet when we had to put him to sleep. I told her my cat told me he was able to go now because he knew someone was there to take over for him in watching over me.

Post 57: anyone else get nervous before EVERYTHING including fun things, rather than getting excited?

and it's not clear why you're nervous, it's not like a "I'm nervous about this" it's more of a "i'm just nervous"

Post 60: Anyone else have to keep reminding themselves the tightness in their chest is probably just anxiety?
Content:
I‚Äôve been so stressed and anxious these past few days, especially after my job closing due to the covid-19 pandemic.  I keep feeling tightness in my chest and then get stressed worrying I might have a mild case.  Then I have to stop and put myself in check.  Do I have a fever?  No.  Body aches and chills?  No.  Dry cough?  No.  Does anyone else have to keep themselves in check like this?

Post 61: Does anyone else write essay-like, highly emotional posts only to think "nah" and delete the whole thing?
Content:
Hello fellow anxious people. Fist of all, If you have or had a shit day, I'm sorry and I hope tomorrow will be better for you. And secondly, yes, initially this was indeed another one of those essays and let me tell you I'm emotionally drained now, still anxious though of course. But instead of deleting everything because of all the "what ifs" and posting nothing at all I thought I'd finally write my first, rather unemotional, post on reddit (yay).

Also I'm procastinating important work stuff because I woke up with a lump in my throat and a nice slice of despair about my life -again- and have now literally been doing nothing but stalking the internet and pacing up and down, feeling bad about it (reasonable, yes). I know, there's not really much to answer on here and honestly, it's just one of those days I feel like an improper human being. I think I really need a very long hug.

&#x200B;

Edit: paragraphs because of the wall of text (sorry, still learning)

Edit 2: Guys I'm overwhelmed by so many of you who can relate. I truly didn't think that I'd get so many answers, upvotes and even awards from you. If I'm honest I was afraid, that my post would get overlooked. But then I woke up to all the nice messages from you and I appreciate it so much!!! Thank you! I'm going to make myself coffee and read every single one of your comments now.

I got a job. 

I actually got a job. I did applications, I did interviews, and I didn‚Äôt have a panic meltdown ONCE. I actually impressed people. I actually got MY FIRST JOB. 

It‚Äôs a data entry clerk position and I can work remotely and there‚Äôs minimal social interaction besides the people on my team.

I never thought I‚Äôd be able to do this honestly. I overthink everything constantly and worry very easily and so I never thought id be able to actually handle a job. 

I even opened up a bank account today for myself. 

Sure, I‚Äôm anxious about starting work and worried I‚Äôm gonna be bad at it..but that‚Äôs a problem for me later. Right now im thrilled I even did it. It can get better y‚Äôall.

Edit: thank you all for all the nice comments :)

Post 66: You are so much braver, smarter, stronger, and kinder than your anxiety tells you that you are.

I wanted to let you know that your anxiety is wrong about you. It pretends to know who you are, but it has no idea. In fact, you prove it wrong over and over and over again, but all it can see are the handful of times it WAS right. 

Keep breathing. Keep thinking kind thoughts. Cry if you like. 

I hope this helps. Whoever you are, please know you aren‚Äôt the only one experiencing this.

Post 68: Something my therapist told me that may help someone: "Mental illness laughs in the face of logic and reason. Please don't torture yourself because your anxiety is off the charts over something 'stupid' or for no reason at all. That's just how your brain works right now. It is OKAY. We can fix it."
Content:
I struggle hard with CBT precisely because a lot of the techniques seem to focus on helping me realize my anxiety is illogical - it's like no Shit Sherlock, I knew that. Sometimes you've just got to give yourself a little grace. Your brain is working its ass off trying to protect you in a world full of 'threats'. Life is hard for an anxious brain.

Post 69: Anyone else feel anxious posting on Reddit purely because people here can be so harsh and judgemental?

Every time I even dare to click the add post button I end up chickening out because I‚Äôm scared of how redditors will react if I do something wrong. Is this just me being silly?

Post 74: Is anyone else starting to worry more about the financial/economic impact of COVID-19 than about the virus itself?
Content:
As a young and relatively healthy individual I'm not worried about contracting the virus, but I am following all CDC and WHO recommendations to prevent transmitting it to those who are more vulnerable. With every passing day I get more and more anxious about the financial and economic crisis that is developing. New reports suggest that this can go on for 12-18 months. I have some huge life events coming up and everything is in flux. What was once solid ground is now complete turmoil.

Post 75: does anyone ever just think to themselves, ‚Äúwow. some people live normally.‚Äù
Content:
like, some people can leave their houses without fearing they‚Äôll die, or that people they walk past in the street will think bad things about them. some people don‚Äôt overthink everything they say and do and overanalyse what other people say and do.

i just find that so strange to think about. i can‚Äôt imagine living like that. really, i wish i could live like that.

Post 77: You are safe
Content:
Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You‚Äôre not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don‚Äôt know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every ‚Äúplease‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù is love. Even when something is someone‚Äôs job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.‚Äù

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, ‚ÄúI will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.‚Äù

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself ‚ÄúI love you, sweetheart.‚Äù

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, ‚ÄúI love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It‚Äôs okay. I got this.‚Äù (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

I love you.

Pass it on.

Post 78: Does anyone else get avoidance anxiety from text messages, emails, Reddit mail, any electronic correspondence?
Content:
Like I enjoy chatting with people in person, over the phone I don‚Äôt mind, either. With new people I get slight anxiety but it‚Äôs not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don‚Äôt always feel like answering at the moment so I‚Äôll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it‚Äôs a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don‚Äôt feel this way is when I‚Äôm either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don‚Äôt go to the gym (usual fear release) and there‚Äôs no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I‚Äôm curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won‚Äôt avoid your replies üòÜ

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else‚Äôs experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that‚Äôs part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

Take care of yourselves, everyone >< Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here

Post 79: Anyone not post because the anxiety of people not liking/down voting your submission is so bad?
Content:
Even if you have something great to post, the anxiety just completely shuts you down.  I know it shouldn't matter what strangers think, and you should be able to express your opinions.  Damn it's hard sometimes.  How do you get over the fear of rejection to at least make an attempt??

I normally deal with a lot of social anxiety, but now that wearing a mask is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù I feel so much safer when going out, like I blend in instead of standing out. I know wearing a mask came from something really bad, but at least something positive did come out of it

My only worry now is what I will do when masks stop being normal again...

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu. 
thanks 

/u/logicalcreations2406 for posting this!


some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

Post 85: I hate when people use ‚Äúpanic attack‚Äù as a way to say they got nervous for a sec
Content:
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but when people have omg moments where they get scared for a sec and say they had a panic attack, it really bugs me. Like no... that‚Äôs not what a panic attack feels like bro... It‚Äôs actually when you feel like you‚Äôre dying for no reason at all. Like all the air in the room is sucked out and logically you know it‚Äôs not true but your whole body and mind is telling you it‚Äôs over. Is that how it felt when you got nervous for a sec when you dropped something or forgot something? It just promotes a culture that misunderstands what people with panic disorders go through.

Post 86: People don't want to admit this but Anxietys root cause is because of the people you were raised with
Content:
Yes we can say "oh stop blaming your parents" but the truth is, the reason why most are struggling with anxiety is because you had guardians who didn't do a good job of making you confident about yourself. Yes you can say its "genetics" but even then, nurture can either make the condition better or worse. You are raised with these people your whole life, the people that surround you growing up effect you whether you like to admit it or not. Maybe your anxious all the time because your parents would throw temper tantrums every time you made mistakes and that manifested later on in to your adulthood, maybe your anxious because you had Authoritarian parents that didn't allow you to grow socially, maybe you are genetically prone to being more anxious and the people you were raised with only enhanced that feeling etc.

All I'm saying is, it's so underrated how much parents can affect there children growing up. It can make life alot more difficult than it should be if your not raised with the right people. 

To adults who are going through anxiety, yes its tougher for us but take it one step at a time. Don't compare yourself to others because they didn't live your life. They didn't face the troubles that you did, every small step you take is progress. I have a toxic family who doesn't see any of my small achievements but to me it's big. The past affects your present but it's about how you deal with it that matters. One step at a time and soon you'll be able to overcome it.

Post 88: I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized & social anxiety disorder.
Content:
I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. 

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression & anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything.

Post 90: I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled.
Content:
I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like "WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?

Content:
I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is " well you gotta get rid of those pills ". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is " stop using meds ". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is " stop using meds, stop using meds ". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh.

Post 94: The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas
Content:
My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am ‚Äúinfected‚Äù so he often won‚Äôt stay in the same room as me, sometimes won‚Äôt talk to me, races away from me and won‚Äôt touch things that I‚Äôve touched.

It‚Äôs incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I‚Äôm divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

I feel so loved by my thoughtful sons.

Post 97: I think I prefer depression over anxiety
Content:
After a very anxious week I feel burnt out. Now I feel just depressed, the kind of depressive state that is tolerable. 

I feel no sadness and anger, I am just tired and indifferent. My brain is so tired that I have no energy to be anxious. That kinda feels good. Without paralyzing terror I can do small things, not overly passionate, but just good enough. 

My baseline is so low, that I feel happy being just depressed.
_____
Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‚ÄòObjectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise. Do not postpone the therapy or whatever you were meaning to do or start. And change that baseline of feeling good to a higher norm‚Äô.

Post 101: I just realised the reason I panic when I make mistakes is because I was punished for mistakes in my childhood.
Content:
One of my earliest memories is from when I was about 4 years old. While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding.

I‚Äôve been managing my anxiety pretty well the past few months but the last week or so I‚Äôve been feeling like I caught a bug and am constantly tired, my chest hurts, I am incredibly moody and have a short temper, have an upset stomach, etc. I called into work sick a day too because I thought I was sick with something and felt so out of it. I attended an event yesterday I‚Äôve been extremely worried about for the past couple weeks and the second I got in the car to leave it‚Äôs like my sickness just disappeared completely and I felt on cloud 9. It was bizarre. Could this all have been due just to the anxiety? I‚Äôve never had this happen before but I‚Äôve been home since and feel back to normal again.

Post 103: How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself
Content:
So if you‚Äôre reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I‚Äôve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don‚Äôt stop, I‚Äôve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I‚Äôve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I‚Äôve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I‚Äôve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I‚Äôve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I‚Äôve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I‚Äôm here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I‚Äôll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn‚Äôt really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you‚Äôre at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don‚Äôt discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you‚Äôre looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don‚Äôt feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don‚Äôt have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you‚Äôll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you‚Äôll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It‚Äôs going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it‚Äôll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you‚Äôre at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can‚Äôt calm down:

At this stage, you‚Äôre either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I‚Äôve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don‚Äôt try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you‚Äôll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn‚Äôt working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won‚Äôt stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you‚Äôve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you‚Äôll find it can‚Äôt. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you‚Äôre interested, the clinical term for this is ‚Äúarousal reappraisal.‚Äù It‚Äôs not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being ‚Äúengaged.‚Äù This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you‚Äôre at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it‚Äôs an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can‚Äôt sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you‚Äôll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they‚Äôre no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you‚Äôll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you‚Äôre in a constant state of panic, they‚Äôre a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don‚Äôt recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I‚Äôve found it doesn‚Äôt really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you‚Äôre thinking or feeling. It‚Äôs a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don‚Äôt need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you‚Äôre getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It‚Äôs much easier to feel short of breath when you‚Äôre in a position that doesn‚Äôt let you breath easily. If you‚Äôre lying down, lay on your back. If you‚Äôre sitting, sit up straight.

Once you‚Äôve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you‚Äôre at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you‚Äôre not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here‚Äôs what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you‚Äôre going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what‚Äôs going on in your brain and body, the better you‚Äôll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they‚Äôll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you‚Äôre knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who‚Äôs been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you‚Äôre at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It‚Äôs aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It‚Äôs long, so I don‚Äôt think you need to do the first part, but there‚Äôs a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren‚Äôt worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as ‚Äúan incurable disease‚Äù in this book. He‚Äôs not a doctor or therapist and isn‚Äôt really knowledgeable on the subject, so I‚Äôd take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn‚Äôt to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you‚Äôll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you‚Äôre saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn‚Äôt know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who‚Äôs right for you, but this is a person you‚Äôll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they‚Äôll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you‚Äôre taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you‚Äôre down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It‚Äôs said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you‚Äôre anxious, but I‚Äôd like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you‚Äôre anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don‚Äôt dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you‚Äôre not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don‚Äôt need to do sprints whenever you run, but you‚Äôll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you‚Äôre having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it‚Äôs almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you‚Äôre just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won‚Äôt go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably read the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of your diet about a hundred times, but I‚Äôll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn‚Äôt entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I‚Äôll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won‚Äôt bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor‚Äôs discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn‚Äôt to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won‚Äôt change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn‚Äôt change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you‚Äôve been at these things for a while, you‚Äôll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you‚Äôre at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you‚Äôve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn‚Äôt manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you‚Äôre able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You‚Äôve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you‚Äôre still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here‚Äôs what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It‚Äôs easy to flounder or stop, and it‚Äôs okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don‚Äôt beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it‚Äôs part of what makes us human. And it‚Äôs okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you‚Äôve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I‚Äôd find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren‚Äôt meant to be fun**. If you‚Äôve got social anxiety and you‚Äôre challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it‚Äôll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you‚Äôll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it‚Äôll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you‚Äôre anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren‚Äôt I seeing my anxiety improve?‚Äù And the answer in this case is because this person wasn‚Äôt pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn‚Äôt expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It‚Äôs okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you‚Äôre seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you‚Äôre constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can‚Äôt find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. 

**5.** Give it time. I‚Äôve said it before but it‚Äôs important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren‚Äôt the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it‚Äôs also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that‚Äôs kind of vague, I‚Äôll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you‚Äôre using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you‚Äôre someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself ‚Äúthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don‚Äôt know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn‚Äôt see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you‚Äôre not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you‚Äôre the one person out of the fifty who‚Äôs somehow figured out you‚Äôre losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it‚Äôs absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you‚Äôre most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they‚Äôre both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you‚Äôll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You‚Äôre in the home stretch. This is it. You‚Äôre likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you‚Äôve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you‚Äôve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I‚Äôd ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you‚Äôve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it‚Äôs a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you‚Äôre almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you‚Äôll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don‚Äôt last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don‚Äôt really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you‚Äôve clearly demonstrated they work. All that‚Äôs left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you‚Äôll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you‚Äôre still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you‚Äôll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you‚Äôve had anxiety and use what you‚Äôve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you‚Äôre able to ease, the better you‚Äôll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would‚Äôve never been able to do.

There really isn‚Äôt much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you‚Äôve done so far and that there‚Äôs more to come.

Then finally‚Ä¶

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That‚Äôs it. All the voices in your head telling you you‚Äôre not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don‚Äôt really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you‚Äôre energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you‚Äôve never had. It‚Äôs been a few months since you‚Äôve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you‚Äôre not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they‚Äôll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don‚Äôt have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you‚Äôll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it‚Äôs telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it‚Äôs telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that‚Äôs not true. If it‚Äôs telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre losing your mind, remind yourself you‚Äôre not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it‚Äôs just anxiety and can‚Äôt do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You‚Äôve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don‚Äôt fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you‚Äôll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you‚Äôre doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you‚Äôve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it‚Äôll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true. You‚Äôll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you‚Äôve been dreading isn‚Äôt half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You‚Äôll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you‚Äôre at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there‚Äôs anything you want me to expand upon. I‚Äôll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don‚Äôt log into this account all that much, so I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt get to your comment as quickly as you‚Äôd like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources.

Post 106: Does anyone else get super sensitive to noise when they‚Äôre anxious?
Content:
Whenever I‚Äôm feeling really anxious my hearing seems super sensitive and sounds/voices can be overwhelming. When I get like this I get super irritated by people talking and loud noises. Does this happen to anyone else? Sometimes it gets to the point where I want to put in headphones to drown out the noises I can‚Äôt control.

Post 107: I always want to post in this subreddit but I know I‚Äôll feel like a failure if I don‚Äôt get upvotes.
Content:
Does this happen to anyone else? I actually think this sub is a great tool for cathartic sharing among people with anxiety, and I know I could derive some benefit in allowing myself to post more. But there‚Äôs some silly irony in me thinking ‚ÄúWell what if this gets ignored? What if people think this is dumb or invalid?‚Äù. Even right now as I type this I think ‚ÄúOh yeah this is so witty and meta, this will definitely get me to the top of the sub‚Äù which is so in line with every obsession I have about being special, being great, being loved, etc ‚Äî and my inability to just do or enjoy the small things for what they are without some greater sense of meaning. 

EDIT: Ha, this blew up, how poetic. The joy or validation I feel from the upvotes doesn‚Äôt match the negativity I would have felt if it went unnoticed, which is good to know! You all are wonderful and this is a great community. I‚Äôve come a long way with my anxiety and I‚Äôm working on a project to help and give back to those struggling and those who have helped me, so I hope to see you all here again. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Post 108: Sending everyone hugs tonight.
Content:
You know who you are. You‚Äôre me, obsessively refreshing the worldnews and politics thread because you can‚Äôt sleep and you can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.  
  
And then you‚Äôre thinking about Australia and the fires, or the flu going around, or how your stomach has been in knots today and you didn‚Äôt eat dinner and now taking a shower seems impossible because there‚Äôs so much happening and you need to know what‚Äôs going to happen next.  
  
I want you to know you‚Äôre not alone, no matter what happens. I may not know you, but I am right there with you, and we can share this together. No matter what happens.  
  
Sending you all so many hugs.  
  
---  
  
Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just "ignore" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>"The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed."  
- Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship

Edit: you guys are the best! I read all the comments, it‚Äôs nice to share the news with other people who shares the same feelings. It took me years of on and off practicing to get here. Good luck to everyone who are practicing and preparing for their test.

There have been so many nights where I just can't fall asleep because that makes tomorrow come "faster".

Post 111: "Trusting your gut feeling" is a lot more difficult when you have anxiety.
Content:
I often hear that when your gut tells you something, it's usually right. But how does this work when you're anxious about every little thing? I never know if it's a true warning or just my anxiety making something out of nothing. It's like my gut is crying wolf all the time. 

Post 112: You are strong . Anxiety is hell. We live through our fears and survive it everytime.
Content:
A lot of people who don't deal with anxiety, or have a panic disorder/generalized anxiety disorder think it's just fear, or being nervous. It is WAY deeper than that. We go through hell. It is more than just having a " phobia " . It is really scary to go through . For some of us it's like being on a bad trip of LSD or weed 24/7 . To everyone reading this , don't be ashamed of your anxiety. You are a freaking warrior. A freaking soldier. I don't care if your anxiety "isn't as bad" as others , or if you don't feel included because you haven't felt the most severe of panic attacks. Maybe your panic attacks are small. I dont care, because you still SURVIVED it. We all did. So to you,  I love you. Keep fighting.

Post 113: I just broke down crying because it feels like no one wants to listen to a man say that he's struggling
Content:
I tried bringing up my struggles with anxiety and depression today and either they don't answer or just tell me they love me, which I appreciate but no one every wants to know what I'm actually feeling and I can only get so much relief from writing in a journal. It's just not the same. Everyone always immediately backs up my girlfriend when she is struggling and I'm just supposed to figure it out.

Post 114: NO ONE IS STARING AT YOU OR NOTICING ALL THE LITTLE THINGS YOU ARE SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT
Content:
Just something to remember. It‚Äôs not meant to sound harsh, but to quiet the anxiety of how you think about your appearance. 

98% of the time, I worry about how horrible I look, my complexion, my hair style, my weight, etc. The other 2% of the time, I remember that no one REALLY looks at you that way except yourself...no one is doing an intense critique of you every time they see you...after all, I can‚Äôt even recall what the people I see every day looked like today lol. 

You are your own worst critic!

Post 115: Anyone else anxious and scared about lockdown being lifted and having to attain responsibility and normality again?
Content:
I've never had much of an issue with being in quarantine, I liked being able to stay inside and watch television or listen to music all day. My country in now in talk to begin easing lockdown within a few weeks and I'm getting very nervous about having to go out and get a job and get back into the cycle where people need me to do things and have expectations of me etc

Post 116: I JUST CALLED INTO A PIZZA PLACE!!!
Content:
I'm still shaking. Making phone calls gives me the biggest anxiety. I asked whether it's not too late to have it delivered into my area. Person said no but that I'd have it better to order it online anyway. So it was a shorter and less complicated phone call than I was preparing for but that doesn't change the fact that I did it! I dialed the fuck out of that number, fucking killed it!! EAT A DICK, ANXIETY.

Edit: I make a phone call and get my first gold in the same day?! This literally made my whole month. Your guys' support, advice and kind words on this post have been overwhelming. I did not expect it to blow up so much but I'm grateful it did. I'm so motivated and inspired by your words that I'm now less scared to push myself even further. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. 

Post 117: Having anxiety is a full time job you don't get paid for
Content:
Well, maybe that's not how it is for everyone, but I am always in my head. Thinking, Planning, problem solving, and of course, worrying. Then worrying some more. I'm never in the current moment, my mind is always in the future. Before I know it, the day is over, and I have barely acknowledged/talked to anybody and barely looked anyone in the eye.

I'm not miserable, I just need to get out of of my head, stop worrying with my mind jumping from one thing to the next, stop getting frustrated and irritated, stop overthinking everything, and instead actually live life and enjoy it.

Post 118: does anyone get extremely anxious when people around them are angry or mad?
Content:
so, i have noticed that whenever someone around me is in a bad mood especially if they are frustrated or angry, i get this feeling like i just wanna hide and lock myself in a box. i usually rush to my room, turn off all the lights to calm myself, put on my earphone and play the loudest music to drain out any loud voices. i think this comes from my traumatic childhood because my parents were always screaming at each other. anyways, does anyone do this? i need some feedback cuz im pretty sure i have anxiety but i dint wanna diagnose myself too early.

Post 119: Anyone else hate it when people think you‚Äôre dumb when it‚Äôs actually anxiety?
Content:
 For instance, I have a new job and it‚Äôs in construction. There a lot of new people there that I don‚Äôt know, there‚Äôs a lot of new situations, it‚Äôs pretty stressful and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing half the time because I‚Äôm an apprentice.

When I‚Äôm in these situations it‚Äôs like my brain doesn‚Äôt function, it doesn‚Äôt think logically at all because it‚Äôs stressful. It just doesn‚Äôt work.

My boss was telling me very important information the other day and added a joke in the middle of it, although because I knew I had to listen and take the information in, I didn‚Äôt catch the joke. Because I didn‚Äôt catch it there was a few people who were laughing at me not getting it, thinking I was thick. 

Anyone else feel like this?

Post 120: Do you guys need constant reassurance that everyone is not mad at you?
Content:
I always assume the worst. And now that we‚Äôre have to practice social distancing it‚Äôs making it a lot easier to think negative thoughts. I know they are irrational but sometimes my mind just convinces me that they are true. I feel like I need constant reassurance from my friends so I know they aren‚Äôt mad me even though it makes no sense for them to be mad at me because there has been no actual conflict between us. I guess since I haven‚Äôt physically seen any of my friends it has gotten really had to stay on track mentally. Like before of this quarantine started we use to spend almost all day everyday together, now everything is through text and for me, I would rather talk to someone face to face so I know what their tone of voice is. Sometimes my mind just thinks really stupid things and it‚Äôs really hard to stop it. Does anybody else feel this way too?

Post 121: Im not stupid, im not unintelligent, im not slow, im just anxious.
Content:

Thats all I wanted to say really.

Post 122: I made a phone call!!!!
Content:
OMFGGGG!!! 
My teacher sent my class a link to apply for this cool position, I asked how to get in contact and he said, "oh, just give her a call" at which point I started spiralling cuz phone calls are hard and just, no!
BUT TODAY I EFFIN DID IT!!!!
I called this woman up, talked to her, didnt trip up on my words, she was really nice AND I GOT THE POSITION!! I'M SO EFFIN PROUD OF MYSELF I CANT BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Post 124: After almost a decade of therapy and psychiatry, it‚Äôs time for me to leave this sub!
Content:
My therapist told me that they do not think I have OCD/anxiety any more. While I might have tendencies, I am not longer classified as having an anxiety disorder and successfully ‚Äúdid the work‚Äù. I never knew this day was possible. Good riddance (with so much love and empathy and compassion!) !!

Edit:

Omg wow this blew up. I‚Äôm so glad this is giving a lot of you hope. You CAN do this! I re-joined the sub following the advice of several commenters, I will stick around and try to help when I see posts where I might be able to offer some insight!! I left a comment below with some of the highlights that stick out to me in regards to what helped me heal, check it out. Lastly, I am about to start getting ready for work but I will hop back on later tonight and get back to you a lot of you who have some excellent questions. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è thank you for all the support!!

Post 125: People with health anxiety, read this!
Content:
Health anxiety ruined a year of my life with a million doctor's visits and sleepless nights and I want to set the record straight for everyone still suffering. Don't fall into the spiral.  
1. Healthy bodies have weird sensations  
2. Healthy bodies have tinglings, numbness and even random pain  
3. Healthy bodies have sudden headaches  
4. Healthy bodies have all manner of random shit happen all the time.  
Anxiety will produce a number of symptoms that will manifest in your mind if you focus on them enough. If you obsess about brain cancer all night, your anxiety will in time manifest all the symptoms you fear if you look hard enough. It is not real. Go on with your day.  
You deserve to enjoy your health while you have it. Don't self-sabotage.  
Take a deep breath, you got this.

Post 126: Does anyone else get really anxious when they send a message to a group chat and they get no replies?

I get so worried and jump to conclusions by automatically thinking that I had said something wrong and that they think I am stupid or I had offended them. I hate the feeling, it makes me so anxious. Can anyone relate?

I just got my new car, better late than never. Drove around my wife, I was really nervous but everything went fine. I am really proud of myself. I drove in traffic, moutain, highway, everything and even in a foreign country. All secured, took a lot of effort since I suffer from GAD. I did it and so proud.

edit : Wow thanks all for this support, I really didn't expect that.

Post 128: The whole world seems excited for lockdown to end, but no one seems to be talking about those of us who are feeling anxious about normal life returning. Surely I am not on my own?
Content:
This has been a strange year for everyone, with huge life changes for all and so much sadness throughout. Even if your lockdown experience has been overly positive, you will undoubtedly have experienced any number of struggles along the way. 

My relationship with my girlfriend ended almost 2 months ago now, and whilst there have been good days and bad days, I can‚Äôt help shake this feeling of dread and anxiety over normal life returning. It‚Äôs as if life is going to take off full speed ahead and I‚Äôm going to be left in its wake, struggling to adjust to this new single way of life. 

Everything you hear on the news speaks about excitement, parties, pubs, nightclubs and all the ‚Äòjoy‚Äô that this is going to bring, but no one seems to address the fact that it‚Äôs going to be a real struggle to adjust back into this ‚Äònormal‚Äô way of life for many of us.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone in this and I‚Äôd love to hear that others are feeling the same way x

Post 129: Omg‚Ä¶. Do you cringe at yourself for oversharing in the moment? I do it like a compulsion I‚Äôm obsessed with feeling understood and afraid of feeling judged
Content:
People can actually develop an opinion of me and thoughts about me when I‚Äôm not around and develop their own opinions and perceptions around outside of how I think of myself.

Fuck does that ever make you anxiety just sitting there?

I sit back and reflect. I‚Äôm embarrassed. I feel so vulnerable. I have social anxiety. 

Venting and need hugs and support

I‚Äôm scared of feeling judged after the fact.

Post 130: Anyone else have barriers in their mind like ‚Äúonce I solve this, I‚Äôll relax and be happy‚Äù only to have another issue once you take care of the first barrier?

I HOPE YOU HAVE AN AMAZING DAY AND REMEMBER- BE KIND TO YOURSELF :)

Post 132: My therapist gave me some information that was a game changer.
Content:
It was another day at therapy. Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it‚Äôs just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who‚Äôs thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don‚Äôt put myself in those situations, I don‚Äôt have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that‚Äôs good! You‚Äôre beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It‚Äôs built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You‚Äôve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it‚Äôs the process of growth. It‚Äôs like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It‚Äôs completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you‚Äôll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I‚Äôm glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it‚Äôs been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!

Post 133: Please start exercising
Content:
I‚Äôve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I‚Äôve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I‚Äôll skip lifting certain days if I‚Äôm too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I‚Äôm a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don‚Äôt notice them. I‚Äôve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I‚Äôm starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I‚Äôm planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven‚Äôt been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself. You‚Äôll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I‚Äôm sorry to anyone who said they‚Äôre unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you‚Äôre having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it‚Äôs subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength.

Post 134: The side of anxiety most people don‚Äôt understand.
Content:
Started a new job about a month ago, finally received my embroidered shirts that I‚Äôm required to wear. Go to put one on and it doesn‚Äôt fit, none of them do. Now I‚Äôm having to wear the plain t-shirt into work until they can order me more. I woke up 2 1/2 hours early to make sure I was ready. Now I‚Äôm sitting in a parking lot nearby being so nervous to have to tell my boss they don‚Äôt fit. Anxiety is having to go through every scenario possible that can happen when I go back in. My body hurts physically and I feel nauseous over this. All over a simple fix that will take him 5 seconds to handle in reality, but my brain doesn‚Äôt work that way. This sucks ‚òπÔ∏è

Post 135: I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it.
Content:
SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

Edit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome. Thank you.

Post 138: A stranger just came out of his way to tell me I was ugly
Content:
I am a girl, 21, and today when I was walking out of work, I passed a guy who was sitting on a bench and he just told me I was ugly ( twice to make sure I could hear it). I suffer from severe anxiety and I tend to hide my face because when I feel like people are looking at me I always feel like they think I‚Äôm repulsive. I take care of myself as much as I can, I put effort in my makeup hair and clothing. I know I am not pretty, but I never thought it was to the point that someone would come out their way just to say it to me. It just confirms that everything i was imagining in my head is true. I want to hide forever. I feel worthless and disgusting. It‚Äôs so stupid I know it. I‚Äôm crying writing that because it broke down the last bit of self confidence I have, it‚Äôs already so hard for me to go out in public and this is just my last straw.

My mind instantly goes to all the worst possible scenarios. It‚Äôs like an addiction to overthink and be anxious. Feels odd to feel calm... anyone else?

Post 141: Wish people realised anxiety is physical too.
Content:
I literally get such a jittery weird feeling in my body so many times a day whenever I'm anxious. Like I can't describe it but it's definitely not good. Almost like something is pinching on my organs. And the worst is when I have to wake up in the morning, it's almost like someone has placed added extra weights to my body. I literally can't get up from my bed! I try to force myself up,but I just can't. I just lay there staring at the ceiling, thinking about what I'll do with my day, get anxious about what if I won't be able to be productive today, then getting anxious about how I wasted some time the previous day, then overthinking it all nd wanting to just kill myself. I hate it.

Post 142: Does anyone else feel like their outlook on life is incredibly dependent on how anxious they‚Äôre feeling at any given moment?
Content:
First time posting/visiting the sub, as my anxiety just seems to be getting worse.

I‚Äôm a senior in college and the uncertainty that lies ahead of me is unbearable. I‚Äôll go through rough phases where everything, from classes to planning for careers/grad school seems like the most daunting thing, and I just wish to stay in the present. I can‚Äôt see a light, and I feel so trapped inside myself it‚Äôs debilitating.

Other days, or periods of time shorter than days, I‚Äôll feel like I have the ability to be and do great. In those few and far in between instances I feel sane, and relatively calm, eager for the future.

What I can‚Äôt stand the most is not controlling how i feel, and when I feel it. It‚Äôs so volatile and I can only hope that days in which important tasks take place are days I feel I‚Äôm in control. I feel like I‚Äôm slowly drowning, and I have no idea how to stop it or stabilize myself.

Post 145: One of the worst things about anxiety is that a good day with your friends can end with you convinced that they all hate you
Content:
I hate that even if I‚Äôm having fun with my friends and meeting new amazing people, I spend the entire night staying up obsessing over all of the little things that I could have possibly done wrong to make people dislike me. I hate that my anxiety convinces me that even though I really did nothing wrong, I must have done something wrong enough for everyone to judge and scrutinize me. I want brain surgery to get rid of this suffering lmao

Post 146: Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?
Content:
Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don‚Äôt know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I‚Äôm currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I‚Äôd say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‚Äògood‚Äô kid so never got into trouble much. That‚Äôs also why I can‚Äôt recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn‚Äôt okay so I don‚Äôt think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student‚Äôs name while I‚Äôm doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn‚Äôt even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‚Äòtroublemaker‚Äô I guess. They‚Äôre the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents‚Äô nerves. They don‚Äôt listen, aren‚Äôt okay with being told ‚Äúno‚Äù and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I‚Äôve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I‚Äôd be in the same room, other times I‚Äôd be in my room and they‚Äôd be downstairs. During these times I‚Äôll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I‚Äôm in the same room I won‚Äôt even say a word and just get up and leave because it‚Äôs too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don‚Äôt understand why this happens to me 

Thank you in advance for the help :)

Post 151: Does anyone feel like your anxiety has made you less intelligent?
Content:
I want to say those with anxiety are naturally intelligent people , we tend to be vivid thinkers,  over analytical and creative.

I've had anxiety disorder about  6 years (it's getting a little better) but I feel like it's messed up my brain. I can't think clear, I don't have interest in things like I used to, i have zero motivation to  care and many things are overwhelming.

I feel like it's hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and I don't have anything important to say. Hell, I don't even know how to "act" around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance.  
My brain is always on , it's exhausting. I obsess about the things that bother me, yet too scared to change them.

Has anyone experienced this and did you do anything to improve it? Sorry if this was long and "venty" I just feel trapped in my head! *Takes brain out and throws it out the window* 

Thank you :-)

Edit: wow thank you everyone for all of your comments. It means a lot that we can share and relate here, to know we are not alone on this. 

Post 152: REMINDER: Your aches and pains are normal, you are safe, you will be okay, you deserve to rest
Content:
I know quarantine gives us all plenty of time to think and hyperfocus on certain physical or emotional feelings. I am here to remind you that you WILL be okay. Don't give up. 

Your physical symptoms, although they feel very real, are normal and aren't going to hurt you. I PROMISE. I know they are so annoying, but the more you wish them away, the more persistent they become. 

You deserve to rest. I know everyone expects productivity from you right now, but it's okay to sleep longer than usual, play video games, or eat what you want. Do what you can, not what you think you should be doing. If everything feels like it's going to shit, take a few deep breaths, turn on some rain noises and take a nap.

Cut yourself some slack. You are going through a tough time. You are exhausted. You are tired of feeling like crap. It feels like it's never going to end. So give yourself a break. This shit is tough, but so are you. Don't beat yourself up.

Three months ago I was genuinely in the worst place in my life. Panic attacks sending me to the ER, dozens of doctors appointments, genuinely convinced I was on the brink of a heart attack. But here I am! Perfectly healthy, and so are you. I pinky promise everything is going to be okay.

No but seriously, I hate that with anxiety comes the diarrhea or bad poops and just the time wasted, which makes me more anxious. Especially if I have to be somewhere and I‚Äôm stuck on the toilet.

If you do not recharge your batteries, then you won't do so well later.

So please do not feel guilty about relaxing. That thing you have to do can wait. And when you're done relaxing, you'll do that thing way better than if you hadn't relaxed.

I hope you all have a great day. :)

Idk if this is the right place to post this, but I felt like I needed to get it off my chest. 

Every other week it seems, maybe for a day or two, I feel like I can do anything, like i'm on top of the world. However, after a day, everything comes crashing down and I feel like shit, almost like I didn't deserve that boost of confidence. It has just been a viscous cycle. 

UPDATE: I just went to the counseling center at my university, and they said I may have bipolar II. Thank you everyone for sharing, it really helps me feel less alone in this. I hope you all get the help you need as well

Post 160: Had anxiety about going to the post office to ship a package, forced myself to go and realized anxiety just makes everything sound worse than it really is and I‚Äôm proud of myself for going!
Content:
I know this sounds so like something so basic but lately my anxiety has been really bad preventing me from doing things 

I had to ship an item that someone bought off me online and I kept putting it off this week because I was too anxious to go to the post office and wasn‚Äôt sure what I would do once I got there.

My boyfriend told me that I should try to go because this was something I needed to do since I already got paid for the item. Sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that you‚Äôll be fine about a certain situation

Once I got back I felt so relieved, it was something so easy to do and I was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about! 

I just personally felt proud of myself and wanted to write this in case anyone has been dealing with similar anxiety, we always tend to make out situations to be worse than they actually are, and you won‚Äôt know the outcome and that most of the time your anxiety is wrong unless you try!

Content:
My heart rate increases. I start to feel like people expect things from me that I can‚Äôt deliver (even though no one is expecting anything from me). I‚Äôve had people in life remark ‚Äúwow, you really have your shit together‚Äù but if only they knew that the outside doesn‚Äôt always match the inside. On paper it looks like I could be an overachiever but I am horribly debilitated by imposter syndrome and feeling like I always have something to prove. I‚Äôm 37F and have come to realize that I need to live in peace with my anxiety and stop trying to yield it to me all the time. It has its own plan and I need to roll with the punches. If I fight it for too long I exhaust myself and feel worse about myself. On my worst days I‚Äôll have to take an Ativan to cope with the zero gravity rib cage crushing feeling - but if I‚Äôm lucky I hope to make friends with it so the floor doesn‚Äôt fall out from under me.

Post 169: Most people are accepting of you having an anxiety disorder, but an unfortunate amount of people expect you to only have symptoms in private.
Content:
A stigma that I‚Äôve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don‚Äôt have a panic attack in front of them, don‚Äôt seek re-assurance from today‚Äôs anxious thoughts and jitters. 

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work. Even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week (I had a co-worker that had this happen at work) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‚Äòwe all have days like that‚Äô ... ‚Äòdon‚Äôt let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable‚Äô 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I‚Äôm lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. 

I felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you‚Äôve been accepted or told to ‚Äòhide‚Äô symptoms from the public to spare THEIR discomfort... like your doing it on purpose. 

Post 170: Does anyone else hate when they start talking about something they‚Äôre passionate about, but then start to feel like they‚Äôre being annoying and then stop talking about it?
Content:
To explain, 

I used to live in a decent sized city, and I found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and it‚Äôs nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country. Anytime I was feeling down or negative I would just hop in my car and go. The drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time I got home I was usually in a much better headspace. I just really loved that drive. 

When explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it‚Äôs impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything. 

‚Äúdoes she actually give a shit about this?‚Äù

‚Äúyou look stupid just stop‚Äù

the usual. 

I then stopped halfway through everything, gave like a half smile and said that I had forgot. 

This is just something that always goes through my head, there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind. Thanks for letting me vent guys.

Post 171: after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!
Content:
I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I‚Äôm really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I‚Äôd have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn‚Äôt really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn‚Äôt. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn‚Äôt stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he‚Äôs Never been impressed by anyone‚Äôs German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

Just had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!

edit: thank you thank you thank you everyone for the kind words. it‚Äôs so awesome to be able to share this excitement with so many people! :) I will update once I hear back about the job.

Content:
I get this with watching shows and reading books I haven‚Äôt before, or even doing crafts. I frequently think I‚Äôd like to do one of these but get anxious about it so I don‚Äôt and just end up on my phone on Reddit (naturally) or watching shows I‚Äôve seen a million times. I think the anxiety might be associated with the distraction or the emotions felt when I do these things - but I feel like a freak who can‚Äôt watch TV shows that everyone else watches and enjoys. Does anyone else have this issue or is it just me??

Post 180: A friendly reminder.
Content:
You're not dying. Those aches and pains you're feeling? Normal. Those muscle spasms in your chest and all around your body? Normal. Feeling like your heart/chest is being squeezed? Also normal. Feeling like you can't breathe/aren't getting enough air/like something is stuck in your throat? Normal. Your heart is pounding and occasionally skipping? You guessed it, also normal. Those feelings of dread and like everything is gonna go wrong? Yep, normal and goes hand in hand with all these sensations when we're too aware of them. 100% of the sensations you're feeling and going through are normal in every day life, We're just unfortunately hyper aware of them. We feel a pain or uncomfortable sensation and our minds immediately go to the worst possible scenario, death, but that won't be the outcome. These things may be scary and uncomfortable, but they won't be the death of us. We've felt them numerous times before and haven't dropped dead then, we won't drop dead now. Stay strong everyone.

Post 181: After a lifelong needle phobia, I managed to get my COVID vaccine!
Content:
(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!

This has been bothering me a lot recently since things in my life have been going well.

Post 183: Do you ever have a single moment when worries escape your mind and you think: there are people who get to live like this everyday?
Content:
Life must be so easy and relaxing... to just live - not constantly battling your mind, not constantly overthinking, not constantly catastrophizing, not constantly evading intrusive thoughts, not constantly having to tell yourself to stop thinking of bad things or the worst unlikely possibilities or past trauma. I wonder how each day must then pass without a huge weight on your shoulders.

Does anyone else experience intense anxiety going back to work after your days off? It‚Äôs particularly bad if I‚Äôm coming back from vacation or a long weekend.

Edit: This post blew up! Thanks for all of the support kind strangers and letting me know I am not alone! Your comments helped me get through a very trying day! 

Also thank you kind strangers for the flair and my first gold!

Post 185: Does anyone else feel anger toward their parents for ‚Äúcausing‚Äù their anxiety disorder?
Content:
As I have gotten older, I have started to realize that my parents(mostly my mom) have a lot to do with my anxiety. My mom has been all over me since i‚Äôve been a little kid. She shit talks everyone, always points out my flaws, and in general has tried to control my life. 

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

My main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me. I am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed. 




**Disclaimer**: let me say that I am not trying to pull a victim card here. I try my best to take responsibility for how I am and am doing my best to correct my issues. My parents have done A LOT for me over the years and I am grateful for that. I just have some internal rage built up.

Sometimes I get so anxious in certain situations I literally could vomit. Sometimes I actually have and idk why this happens?

Post 188: UPDATE: Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.
Content:
As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update.

Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today\_i\_had\_a\_job\_interview\_and\_i\_managed\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today_i_had_a_job_interview_and_i_managed_to_go/) 

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to "guarantee" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about " having some upper respetory symptoms " or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says " You do everything you can, and that's all you can do ". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work. Fml.

Post 189: Does anyone else feel panicked when they have free time because you don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúproperly‚Äù spend it?
Content:
This will be a massive ramble but PLEASE chime in if your brain goes through the same ridiculous thought processes...

I feel like I have no identity or hobbies and that the hobbies i do have aren‚Äôt the ‚Äòright‚Äô ones. I like to read and play sims. Sometimes i scrapbook or pour paint but part of me feels like i do those things to be able to say ‚Äòi did something artsy today.‚Äô I‚Äôm interested in astronomy but i don‚Äôt know how to even start or what an amateur astronomer even does and then i feel imposter syndrome for liking it but not DOING anything astronomy related.

Part of me wants to try new things but other parts of me know this would be just to check off some boxes and i‚Äôd be back to square one anyway.

I feel like i have no purpose and i waste my free time trying to figure out who i am instead of being able to BE who i am. I just want the world to pause until i figure it the fuck out so i dont waste another day feeling like this. this has been going on for probably a decade now. 

Ugh. Exhausting.

Post 190: Does anyone else get "pee anxiety"? Like, when you know you won't be able to use a restroom for a few hours, you get really anxious about it and end up thinking about needing it the whole time?
Content:
Most of the time happens on longer trips or exams. It also usually ends in actually having to pee cause I couldn't get it out of my mind.

Post 191: Does your Anxiety manifest itself in stomach pain or digestive problems?
Content:
I have dealt with anxiety for so many years now and in the last 5 years especially I've noticed that I just get knots or like IBS in certain situations (relationships, high stress work stuff, etc) and it affects my appetite or mood.

Post 192: Tell me you have anxiety without telling me you have anxiety

For me it is snapping at someone when I‚Äôm overwhelmed then feeling horrible about it because it was anxiety talking not me.

Post 193: I PASSED MY DANG DRIVERS LICENSE TEST TODAY AND SO CAN YOU
Content:
Hey yall I passed my behind the wheel drivers license test today!!!! It was my third try!!! I am 24 years old and have put off driving for a long time because it gave me so much anxiety to think about being in control of a vehicle on the road. I have been practicing  (and crying ngl lol) for almost an entire year and honestly felt pretty hopeless after the first two tests. I was so anxious during the exams!! Literally hands shaking and at moments felt like I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù and that horrible sunken feeling in my stomach whenever I get anxious about anything. 
 

But i did it!!! If I can do it so can you!!! I see you, and I know you‚Äôre doing your best :) you will get it! 

Random but interesting note: when I pulled into the DMV parking lot ‚Äúdrivers license‚Äù by olivia rodrigo started playing on the radio 

HAPPY 420 !!

Post 194: Does anyone else's stomach gets upset when anxious ?
Content:
My stomach always begins to ache when anxious . At times I have to excrete too . Sometimes it is painful .

Post 195: Ordered a coffee by myself for the first time in my life!
Content:
The title says it all, I've never been into a Starbucks before and I'm 27 years old. The flashy drinks, bright lights and people all felt too overwhelming.

However, today I decided to go out into the park and I really craved a cup of hot coffee and only place around was a massive Starbucks.

I had no idea how to order or what to order so I asked the nice girl at the counter for a recommendation and size, waited for my cup and even drank it inside surrounded by people without a single panic attack! 

I feel really proud of myself and I have no one to share it to. 
:)

Post 196: Does anyone else's anxiety give them an upset stomach?
Content:
I get super nauseous when I am anxious. I get a surge of adrenaline when my phone pings, and my hands are shaking by the time I pick it up. Having my ringer off makes me even more anxious because I don't know when someone has texted or called. Especially when texting my SO. There's no reason to have anxiety texting him but I always do. I am not even worried for a reason and yet my hands shake so much I can barely type.

Having a friend or my SO coming over at noon? That's right, trying not to vomit all morning and getting super bloated! By the time they arrive I often feel too sick to enjoy myself. I used to miss school because I would get so sick from anxiety in the morning. Does anyone else have their anxiety give them an upset stomach?

Post 197: You've made it through every anxiety attack you've ever had.
Content:
Sometimes in the midst of a panic/anxiety attack you can feel like it may never end, or worse end abruptly with your death. 

But you have a 100% survival rate for every anxious period of your life. You've never died, never lost control, you've never completely lost your mind. 

You can make it, because you always do!

Post 198: Does anyone else get gastrointestinal issues when they are very anxious?
Content:
I get gassy, crampy, and sometimes full on runs just from being anxious. My stomach will hurt and occasionally I'll get heartburn. Only when I'm highly anxious.

I just wondered if anyone else gets this and can't think of anywhere I'd be more comfortable asking....

Edit - wow, this blew up. I had no idea this was such a common thing!

Post 199: I did it!
Content:
I went in to my local coffee shop and ordered a mocha latte first time without being nervous. I feel really happy about it.
 
Edit: Wow thank you for the awards. I appreciate it and nice comments

Post 200: I‚Äôm so worried about wasting my time that I wind up wasting my time
Content:
It sucks. I‚Äôm sure all of us have these days where we have a whole list of goals we want to accomplish but our time anxiety gets the best of us. 

I‚Äôve tried doing the small goals approach, but I wind up feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. My lack of self motivation is so atrocious it‚Äôs a miracle I can wake up at normal times.

Have any of you had success combatting these issues? It sucks because I want to continue with my future but my complacency from anxiety and depression just wraps itself around me.

Post 201: My mother just told me that most people don‚Äôt over analyze and obsess over their mistakes made years ago? What is this witchcraft?
Content:
So I showed her that meme of the girl lying in bed trying to sleep while her mind decides to suddenly replay her most embarrassing moments. And my mom said ‚Äúdoes that actually happen to you?‚Äù

And I just... does it not happen to most people? You mean to tell me that most of the world is just putting their mistakes in the past and moving on with their lives? What? How?? 

That sounds so emotionally healthy! Meanwhile multiple times a week I lie awake at night replaying the moments I most wish hadn‚Äôt happened.

Edit: Did not know this would resonate with people... also apparently this is a symptom of my OCD!

Post 202: Anyone else get horrible gastric problems from their anxiety?
Content:
I already have IBS in my family (yay, me), but I‚Äôve found that my anxiety makes my stomach problems so much worse. It‚Äôs constant off-and-on problems with cramping, gas, bloating, diarrhea, nausea and sometimes outright pain. Sometimes I‚Äôll get a jolt of nerves and the suddenly I have horrible stomach pain. Other times I just feel mildly sick. It doesn‚Äôt even matter what I eat, nothing seems to help. It can be really discouraging and debilitating. When my anxiety is higher, it always makes these problems WAY worse. Then the vicious cycle begins and it gives me MORE anxiety. 

Am I alone in this? I hate anxiety!

Post 203: does anyone else‚Äôs anxiety cause them to speak really fast and finish people‚Äôs sentences, leading to really weird conversations that don‚Äôt last long?
Content:
Personally, it‚Äôs like I can never just relax and let the conversation flow naturally. 

Sometimes I mumble my replies as well like I‚Äôm not confident enough to make my words audible, so that‚Äôs also pretty weird. It‚Äôs like I know I‚Äôm being weird but I physically cannot stop.

Post 205: Does anyone else get heightened anxiety at nighttime / before bedtime?
Content:
Nighttime is hard. Winters are hard. Winters when the sun sets at 5 pm are very hard. Getting to sleep is hard on a good day, and even harder for me these days. Sadly, the lack of sleep only fuels my anxiety and it feels like a hopeless cycle. 

Does anyone else experience very heightened anxiety at night? If so, what remedies have you found that worked to get you sleeping through the night? Any advice would be appreciated!

Edit: 
Wow! This community never ceases to impress me! Thank you all for your amazing suggestions and ongoing support, I‚Äôm truly touched by everyone‚Äôs suggestions. I made a list of the suggestions I‚Äôve received so far to consolidate them all in one place for an easy reference guide. I‚Äôll try to add more as I see them and catch up with comments:

- Develop a consistent sleep schedule / routine 
- Incorporating exercise into routine 
- Drinking herbal teas before bed 
- Using a weighted blanket
- Reading  
- Journaling 
- Listening to podcasts (some are also dedicated to helping you fall asleep!)
- Watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating ‚Äúworry time‚Äù and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren‚Äôt sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol 

We are not alone. We are strong. We are loved. We will get through this.

Post 206: I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives
Content:
I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my "free time" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of "am I just lazy" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. Thank you all so much.

Post 207: Does anyone else get extremely distressed at minor criticism?
Content:
Getting even slight negative feedback, particularly at work, makes me panic and feel distressed and anxious for the rest of the day. I feel like I'm not good enough and that everyone is thinking the same negative things about me. I know this is unhealthy, but I can't help it. Even kindly worded constructively criticism make me feel awful. Does anyone else feel like this? How can I stop it?

Post 208: Does anybody get anxiety from the thought of being bothersome to others?
Content:
My anxiety always seems to ramp up at the thought of asking any clarifying questions about something. I get the feeling that the person I'm asking the question to might think of me as annoying or stupid.

It doesn't help that I also get anxiety from not knowing how to do something or the rules for something.

Post 209: Does Anyone Else Ever Feel Embarrassed About Their Whole Existence?
Content:
Like you‚Äôre just embarrassed about yourself, you‚Äôre embarrassed when people acknowledge you, you‚Äôre embarrassed whenever someone mentions something that you did. Just anything that reminds you that you actually exist.

Also, do you guys ever feel like literally EVERYBODY hates you?

Please, be kind, lads. I promise, I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings. It‚Äôs not intentional.

Edit: Came back to Reddit a day after writing this post and seeing that it has so many upvotes is crazy! It feels so good that it‚Äôs not just me that feels like this. Well, obviously it‚Äôs not good that we feel like this but I mean, it helps knowing that I‚Äôm not alone in this, if that makes sense.

We‚Äôre all worth more than we think, you guys.

Post 210: Does any else get that feeling when you're actually doing well and your mind is at peace and then you get a thought saying "Remember, you're not okay, you should be anxious about something"?
Content:
It's so annoying, I'm doing okay and then my brain reminds me "oh you're not okay, remember you've been feeling anxious" and then I get anxious and really, really sad that I'm not fully okay. What do I do about it? It causes me a great deal of distress sometimes.

Post 211: My mom passed away and I'm completely numbed

Post 213: I just danced to old 50‚Äôs music by myself in a dark basement at 6:30 AM in the morning and it‚Äôs the happiest I‚Äôve been in a very long time.
Content:
I like to listen to old music from the 50‚Äôs when I‚Äôm in my head a little too much, I randomly saw a r/GetMotivated post that told me to live in the moment. So I started dancing because it‚Äôs the first thing I wanted to do, I‚Äôm usually never a softy like this, and I‚Äôm a little embarrassed to say it, but it‚Äôs the happiest I‚Äôve been since well before the epidemic started. Nothing else has matched this, not even my favorite videogame coming out, or my best friends birthday party, just me all alone, dancing Elvis style, like a basement dwelling rat. Something about it felt so liberating, I‚Äôve danced before but never in pure ecstasy like this. To be fair I‚Äôm extremely baked.

That‚Äôs all, thanks to the one person that wasted precious seconds of their life reading this.

Post 214: Does anyone feel like if they‚Äôre doing leisure activity then they‚Äôre ‚Äúwasting time‚Äù?
Content:
I can‚Äôt convince myself to start a movie, tv show, hobby because I have the constant nag going in my head telling me I should be being more productive even though I might end up watching equal hours of videos online instead. The voice doesn‚Äôt let me continue with hobbies either once I get good at them because I could be getting better at something else I‚Äôm not good at now. I think it has made me a more well rounded and a person with diverse interests but I hate that I don‚Äôt LOVE anything. Everything seems like a mean to an end but there is no end! Does this kind of anxiety stay with anyone?

Post 215: My bf asked me what my social anxiety is like and this is what I sent him.
Content:
When in a social situation, I struggle with constant thoughts akin to this:

‚ÄúWhat do I say now? Do I laugh here? Was I not supposed to laugh at that? Omg, I just laughed at that and they were serious and now I gotta fix it. Make this joke. No, dont. You know what, it‚Äôs a funny joke. I shouldn‚Äôt have made that joke. They‚Äôre not laughing. I knew that was a stupid joke to make. They think I‚Äôm stupid. Yikes. I wonder if they‚Äôre looking at my teeth. Do they notice my crooked smile? Smile less. I look unfriendly, smile more. I probably look really stupid smiling and nodding so much. Say something. Say something! I‚Äôve literally been laughing this whole time and haven‚Äôt said a single thing except that really dumb joke I made earlier. They think I‚Äôm an airhead. They don‚Äôt like me. I wonder if that compliment they just gave me was them just being nice. Smile and say thank you. Change the subject. Wait! I forgot to compliment them back. I messed up. They hate me. Try again tomorrow.‚Äù

Does this resonate with anyone else here?

Post 217: Anyone else just hate working in general?
Content:
I don't know about you, but does anyone just feel like they just don't care for the corporate work life in general? Being at everyone's beck-and-call, being thrown a hundred tasks with deadlines in your way, dealing and communicating with all sorts of "personalities", People blowing up your Slack/Discord, etc. I only just realized how much of a nightmare it is for an anxiety sufferer. And it doesn't even matter  if it is your dream job, you still have to deal with the same shit. If it was up to me, I'd rob a bank or win the lottery and not work anymore.

After 5.5 years of off and on anxiety and depression, I finally addressed my issues with my doctor this morning. I‚Äôm going on medication and crossing my fingers that it helps me start living my life again. 

I‚Äôm not sure if anyone actually cares, I just had to share. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

EDIT: wow this post was a lot more popular than I thought it would be! Thank you everyone!! I feel so much better and like there‚Äôs finally a light at the end of the tunnel (or at least a start). I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions anyone might have or just share my experience! You can send me a PM if you aren‚Äôt comfortable commenting here :)

Post 221: hidden ways you‚Äôre keeping your body in fight or flight mode
Content:
1. tongue cemented to the roof of your mouth? not only are you tensing your jaw, you‚Äôre constricting the muscles in your throat. this can make it feel like it‚Äôs closing, and can make you swallow more air which in turn can make your stomach hurt. let your tongue rest.

2. head feel heavy as hell? kinda dizzy and wobbly? like a band wrapped around your head?
tension headaches. your neck doesn‚Äôt wanna hold up your head anymore. before freaking yourself out. focus on your neck and shoulder muscles, are they sore as hell? move your neck around. drop your shoulders. massage them. watch how fast your head clears up.

3. feel gassy? like you need to burp or fart or something? you just might. get on your knees, put your ass in the air and relax that butt. drink club soda. do yoga. being too gassy can keep an anxious person in fight or flight. 

4. speaking of butts, are you clenching your butthole really tight for no reason? mhm. your body thinks it‚Äôs in danger. relax that thing.

5. let your damn tummy hang out. no one cares. give your guts some room to breathe. then breathe WITH that tummy, not your chest.

6. PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. BREATHE OUT. DEEP BREATH OUT. HOLD YOUR BREATH. 
THEN BREATHE IN. YOU SHOULD BE BREATHING IN HALF AS LONG AS YOU BREATHE OUT. YOUR LUNGS KNOW WHAT TO DO, BREATHE RIGHR FOR THEM.


you can‚Äôt relax your mind if your body is not relaxed. check these off. then calm your mind. i hope they help. ‚ù§Ô∏è


Edit: regarding #1, i did NOT think i would have to point this out because i believe in the intelligence you guys have but, your tongue naturally sits on the roof of your mouth. by saying ‚Äúcemented‚Äù i tried to relay that putting an unnecessary amount of pressure on the roof of your mouth can keep you in fight or flight or tense. not just lightly holding it there. again, thought my choice of words put that message across. i apologize to Mew zealots everywhere. thank you.

Post 222: I wish people would understand that anxiety isn‚Äôt always full blown panic attacks
Content:
It‚Äôs not just getting really breathless and panicky for a short period of time, or being scared to go into social situations. It‚Äôs feeling breathless for days, it‚Äôs headaches, dizziness, poor memory, no appetite, it‚Äôs all these physical symptoms that just add to this feeling hovering over you that there‚Äôs something wrong all the time like a cloud. i‚Äôm sorry for ranting but i just needed to get this out

Post 223: My best friend became a mass murderer. I‚Äôve never been the same since that day.
Content:
So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It‚Äôs been several years, about 6, and while I‚Äôll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I‚Äôm just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn‚Äôt help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I‚Äôm pretty sure he either didn‚Äôt want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn‚Äôt even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn‚Äôt do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn‚Äôt realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he‚Äôd try to change the subject. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn‚Äôt even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn‚Äôt feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like ‚Äúoh let‚Äôs smoke a bowl that‚Äôll cheer you up!‚Äù And that was when I had my first panic attack. I‚Äôm talking full on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna die oh my god.‚Äù This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn‚Äôt sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it‚Äôs caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can‚Äôt really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don‚Äôt really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he‚Äôs never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I‚Äôm kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It‚Äôs hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can‚Äôt focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I‚Äôd love to answer, but I‚Äôd also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I‚Äôm in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don‚Äôt deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that‚Äôs stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a ‚Äúhaha I got you‚Äù thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I‚Äôm trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven‚Äôt responded yet, I will definitely try. I‚Äôll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously.

Double annoying: Because we're always fine after a panic attack, a panic attack is actually a sign that everything is fine and you're not in any danger.

But its still terrifying every time. I hate panic attacks.

Post 228: Do you think it's fair to say the past year has been traumatic?
Content:
I feel permanently changed by everything that's happened this past year. I am exhausted. I feel bitter and angry and sad. I have never hated people the way I do now. There are times that I feel like going outside and just screaming at the sky until I can't anymore. And I feel gaslit by the people around me who want to pretend that nothing is wrong. 

I'm very lucky that the events of this year haven't had a huge direct impact on me - I have a job and a place to live, my loved ones are alive. But it feels like everything else is just a giant fucking nightmare. All I want to do is sleep and pretend I don't exist. I don't think I'm ever going to be completely okay after this, even if things do someday become "normal" again, whatever that even means.

I haven‚Äôt left my house for nearly 3 months because my anxiety and physical symptoms have been so severe. Yesterday I felt okay enough to at least give it a go, so I did.

I was only out for about 6 or 7 minutes- but it felt good! I went to the store near my house and picked up some gum and a drink. 

I even cried a little on my way home because I was so proud. Hopefully this is the start of some big changes for me

I hear a lot of people with anxiety talk about having anxiety attacks or panic attacks, but it‚Äôs never really been that way with me.

Post 233: I WENT TO A PARK BY MYSELF
Content:
I‚Äôm a 26 y/o and for the first time since high school I was able to go for a walk at a public park by myself! 

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I‚Äôm just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

I've never had a salary position in my life. I'm a single mom and I've been on food stamps and utility assistance for the past year. This is going to be absolutely game changing for me and my family. I'm SO proud of myself! I've had debilitating anxiety, depression, and ADHD for years so believe me when I tell you that anything is possible!!!!

I‚Äôm sorry for that horribly constructed sentence. I‚Äôm a weird split between extroverted and introverted, but I LOVE having a day or two to myself to just do whatever I‚Äôd like in the comfort of my cozy home. However, my anxiety makes it SO hard to do that sometimes, and the guilt of doing ‚Äòrelaxing‚Äô things when I should be doing other things, and my lack of ability to concentrate, my angry thoughts, all tend to sweep up that day full of potential and curb stomp it on the ground. I end up crying, getting nothing done, and also not being able to relax, so then I‚Äôve wasted a day and now I feel 100x worse about myself. 

Does this happen to anyone else?

Post 243: Anyone else suffer from driving anxiety?
Content:
Seriously, I don‚Äôt understand how people aren‚Äôt absolutely terrified of driving. You‚Äôre inside a three-ton metal death machine surrounded by other death machines, all speeding down a narrow strip of concrete in close proximity to one another. One tiny slip up, just the slightest bit of drift, could kill or horribly maim you and everyone else around you. If you do cause a crash, you could be left dead, debilitatingly injured, or with a lifetime of guilt for hurting someone else.

I hate seeing people get mad at me when I make a mistake. I hate wincing in fear when I have to squeeze between a parked car and the opposite lane, praying I don‚Äôt hit someone. I hate when people tailgate me when I‚Äôm at the speed limit or slightly above. When I see children walking dangerously close to the road I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll trip and end up under my wheels, with me not having time to brake. There are so many variables and the risks are so high. How people enjoy it is beyond me.

Anyone else feel like this?

Post 244: Life Pro Tip: Do NOT constantly be watching the news on this stuff

Keep informed on key updates and take the medical advice seriously (distancing, washing hands, etc). 

But trust me, do NOT be watching the news 24/7, googling it all the time and scrolling World News subreddit constantly for updates. **This will destroy your mental health.**

People who don't have anxiety are panicking, so what the hell do you think those with anxiety will behave like?

It's not worth it. I haven't watched the news in 2 days and I've now put several subreddits on block. Honestly my anxiety is WAY less! It really does make a difference.

No matter how good I do at work, how many compliments I get, I can't shake the feeling that I am on borrowed time. That eventually they will figure out I shouldn't be there. That I am one bad day, one bad call, one mistake away from the end.

Every time my boss says "can I talk to you for a minute?" My heart rate spikes.

Post 248: Anyone else have "functioning" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?
Content:
Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my "brave face" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear "normal."

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't "deserve" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.


EDIT:

Thank you all for your support, advice, and kind words. When I posted this I never imagined it would get this much attention. It‚Äôs so wonderfully comforting to know that I‚Äôm not the only one going through this.

Post 249: Medication has made me realized how much anxiety I actually had compared to how much I thought I had
Content:
I've had anxiety all my life and this year, especially after all the covid lockdowns, I noticed my anxiety and depression was significantly worse than usual. So I went on medication this time.

The first week was terrible but as it's settling in, my anxiety is disappearing. I had no idea that my anxiety was as bad as it was until it disappeared. Before the medication, if I had a problem at work or with another person, I would dwell on it for hours or sometimes days. I presumed I was just a sensitive person but I've realised it was the anxiety.

I thought my anxiety were just the attacks I had or when it was really bad that I couldn't leave the house, I did not realize I had it every single day. I must have just got so used to having anxiety all my life that it seemed normal to me.

I can actually deal with issues as they arise rather than having to tip toe around it. There is a big chuck of what I thought was my general personality that has actually turned out to be my anxiety.

Post 251: Stop telling me everyone has anxiety!
Content:
I understand anxiety is a common thing and happens to everyone. But it‚Äôs still an incredibly invalidating thing to hear. I‚Äôm not sure everyone spends over half an hour picking out an outfit, can‚Äôt get on the bus by themselves because they‚Äôre irrationally afraid of pulling the stop cord wrong, or overthink everything, down to how long they should toast their bread for.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm some special case or anything, I know many have it much worse. I often excuse my constant worrying by prefacing to someone that I have anxiety, and hate when they just say ‚Äúoh well everyone has anxiety‚Äù. 

I know that, but sometimes, I wish someone would just say ‚Äúthank you for telling me.‚Äù 

Sorry for the rambling to whoever actually read this.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for responding to my little rant. I‚Äôve been cooped up in my apartment because of COVID feeling very much alone. I‚Äôm glad to know I am not alone in how I feel :-)

EDIT2: wow, I was shocked when just a few people replied. thank you everyone for commenting. i do want to say I feel no malice towards those who comment those things about anxiety, but I also think it goes to show how important mental health education is. I know when people say these things they come from a good place :)

Post 252: This time last year I couldn‚Äôt leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.
Content:
I‚Äôm a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn‚Äôt leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it‚Äôs just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who‚Äôs notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can‚Äôt touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I‚Äôm still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done, and I failed at times but didn‚Äôt stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask, and my PMs are always open to help anyone!

Post 256: Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?)
Content:
Hi. I‚Äôve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I‚Äôm an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I‚Äôll be home for 3-4 days straight, can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple ‚Äúsocialization for the day.‚Äù I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can‚Äôt bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve reached such a level of being a slob that I can‚Äôt bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won‚Äôt get back (though let‚Äôs be real, I won‚Äôt be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I‚Äôm torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that‚Äôs my problem?

I‚Äôd also like to remind everyone that we have an active Discord server: https://discord.gg/9sSCSe9

I wanted to talk about breathing.  

A very common technique for coping with anxiety is to breathe deeply - you‚Äôve probably heard this or seen it in an infographic.  This is indeed a helpful technique, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think it is explained well and I have often seen users say that it can make their anxiety worse.  This comes as no surprise when in response to anxiety or a panic attack all you hear is ‚Äútake a breath!‚Äù  Great, I‚Äôll do that, thanks.  I‚Äôm going to break down the proper technique piece by piece in the hope that it helps someone out.  

When you are anxious many people feel like they are hyperventilating and the answer to that is because you tense up and your breathing becomes shallow and ‚Äúhigh up‚Äù (your breaths are filling your upper lungs) which makes the anxiety worse.  You are, in fact, hyperventilating, but you can fix this.  You are in control of your breath as much as it may not feel like it in a moment of panic.  

What you want to do is called [diaphragmatic breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing) (or belly breaths if you‚Äôre a normal person and not in a medical profession).   To demonstrate this, sit up in a comfortable position and place a hand gently beneath your ribs and on your upper belly - concentrate on expanding this area with each inhale.  This is the breathing you are aiming for.  

What we will be doing is commonly called ‚Äú[box breathing](https://imgur.com/0N53Gah)‚Äù.  

Taking belly breaths:

1. Slowly inhale on a count to four (I find through the nose most effective but breathing through the mouth will do you no harm - just keep it slow). 
1. Hold the breath for a count to 4
1. Exhale for a count to 4
1. Hold the empty lungs for a count to 4.  

Repeat until your anxiety eases or your breathing resumes a normal rhythm.  

That‚Äôs it!  I hope this explanation helps out someone, I know it certainly helped me.  Practice it when you‚Äôre calm and the next time the anxiety ramps up, give it a try.  I‚Äôve also used this technique to steady myself for taking low-light photos and building card towers.  Bonus.  

Love, 

Remy

Content:
I'm scared to post anything here. I can't count the number of times I've had an entire post/comment written out, and I delete it because I get scared. Getting downvoted is terrifying to me. If I have an opinion that might be umpopular, delete. It's not that I don't know how to express myself, I'm just scared to.

Post 264: Do you randomly get an awkward thought and cringe physically?
Content:
Hi I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm alone but  randomly while doing work i would get awkward thoughts or memory and I‚Äôll cringe? 
like noticeably cringe to the degree that if I was reading something, I would read it louder. Or I would say random things out load because of all the awkward energy. 

Please tell me that I‚Äôm not alone

TLD;R I get physical reactions to thoughts

Edit: We got a nameee for ittt!!! It is called ‚Äúcringe attacks‚Äù and you can find it on google! thanks u/Thy_Introvert

Edit 2: it‚Äôs most likely a form of intrusive thoughts. We all have stupid crazy thoughts, that‚Äôs ok and very normal. What may indicate a problem is when the existence of this thought begins to persist, bother you, affect your mood, your life or relationship with people. Having the though is no problem but your *reaction* to the though might indicate something bigger like OCD. Please stay safe and consult a professional if you think it indicates a deeper issue‚ù§Ô∏è

Content:
I have extreme anxiety with the phone. I don't know but it stresses me out. I got a call from my doctor and let it go to voicemail as usual. But I said fuck it. Practiced what I was going to say a million times and called back. I was shaking the whole time but I did it and I'm really proud of myself. I'm slowly exposing myself to social things and this was the first step!

Post 266: For every upvote, I will read one AOL Instant Messenger chat log from my high school days.
Content:
I just found a folder of my old chat longs from age 12 to about 20. There's hundreds of files here.

I already think so much about the embarrassing shit I did back in my teenage years. Why not ruin any chance or repairing my social anxiety by reading every single one and committing them to long term memory? It'll be like suicide for my sanity 

I already found one chat where I told one of my online-only female friends that I loved her... I was 13.

Post 267: Does anyone else get this sense of "dread" everytime you're home because you gotta go back to work the next day?
Content:
I always get this dreaded feeling everytime i am home. At work i feel fine, no anxiety but everytime i come home i get anxiety about the next day.

Even if it's friday i start dreading monday. I don't even dislike my job that much but i think it may have to do with very bad job experiences with not so nice employers/colleagues.

Anyone else get this feeling? I am diagnosed with Unspecified phobic anxiety mild to moderate.

Post 268: Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it‚Äôs mania because it‚Äôs so unusual.
Content:
Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you‚Äôll know I‚Äôm mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I‚Äôve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I‚Äôve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I‚Äôm not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I‚Äôm not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it‚Äôs actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I‚Äôm not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I‚Äôve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I‚Äôm allowed to be happy. I‚Äôm allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too.

Post 272: Does anyone else get home from work and obsess over every interaction they've had during the day?
Content:
This happens to me every day I come home from work. I'll have constant flash-backs to some cringy thing I said or did and I just sit on the couch and freak out and it makes chilling after work impossible. 

It doesn't help that im super anxious around people so I'm always overanalysing myself at work and I'm constantly worried about coming across some type of way and so I don't say much (which i think probably just makes me seem rude anyway). 

Is anyone else stuck being so critical over every interaction they have? And has anyone found anything that helps them wind down after interacting with people? I'm so exhausted mentally and it makes work hell. 

Sorry for any formatting issues I'm on mobile.

Post 273: Does anyone else talk to themselves and have conversations in your mind all day, everyday?
Content:
I tend to over think EVERYTHING from having to plan my trip to the store to my boyfriend not cuddling me before we go to sleep leaving me crying because I think he doesn‚Äôt love me anymore. It affects me so much in my life when sometimes it‚Äôs not even worth it, it‚Äôs just me entertaining a unrealistic thought. Everyday from the moment I wake up till I go to sleep I am talking to myself in my brain mostly it speaks negatively it makes me overthink everything I do. I am at the point where I know I am overthinking and entertaining unrealistic ideas but once it‚Äôs in my mind I can not get it out. I get these thoughts that somehow get into my mind and I won‚Äôt let go of it and keep digging at it and keeping the topic wondering in my mind all day or for days even. It can be something so small and I can‚Äôt focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just making yourself over think, you‚Äôre doing this to your self just stop overthinking‚Äù which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running. This happens even when I am trying to go to sleep which makes sleeping soo hard i have gone to the doctor for insomnia and depression but I have never thought these are the results and side effects of having tons of anxiety. It‚Äôs all a dangerous cycle I have fell in for years. Although at first i remember it being mostly depression and feeling of helplessness but these days it‚Äôs not even me getting anxious from being depressed because I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm depressed anymore but I just anxious, more than I ever have been. So I‚Äôm starting to see maybe it‚Äôs anxiety that is the stem for most of my other problems. I‚Äôm so tired of it effecting my everyday life. If you have any tips for making your mind not be so loud and controlling please leave comment I am so tired of letting myself bring myself down every single day.

Post 275: I hate my life right now as an American.
Content:
There's no more structure.  There's no more rules.  There's chaos everywhere and there's no end in sight.  All the positive momentum I had built up before shit hit the fan is now gone.  I'm barely keeping it together.  I'm running out of money and I'm running out of medication.  I'm terrified to go back to work because I know they won't protect me.  I've become pre-diabetic in quarantine because of a culmination of bad habits, and I have no money to see a doctor about it.  

&#x200B;

I honestly don't know how to proceed.  I'm frozen in fear of every option.  I barely eat.  I have no sleep schedule anymore.  I don't know what to do with myself.  I don't want to be here anymore.

Content:
I know politics have gotten super crazy I'm the last few years, so I hope we can have a civil discussion. With the election so close and reading up on the crazy stuff going on, I'm terrified to be living in America. That's so wild and depressing to say! I feel my mental health is getting worse and I just want this to be over. I'm worried that this week will get crazy and there's nothing I can do. It's like reading a history book without knowing the outcome. How is everyone else coping through this week?

Edit: 2 things- thanks to all the replies. I've read each and every single one of them. It's a bit reassuring to see most people with the same views and worries. 
I've also been impressed with the civility in this post. Also gives me a glimmer of hope for our society.

Post 278: Does hearing the sentence "I have bad news" make your anxiety shoot through the roof?
Content:
I *hate* when someone tells me that they have bad news. My stomach drops and all kinds of terrible scenarios run through my head. And 99% of the time the "bad news" ends up being something trivial like the grocery store is out of garlic powder. I wish people didn't use that phrase so lightly. 

Post 279: I have anxiety and I'm terrified of confrontation so I create arguments in my head where I can say what I really feel. Does anyone else relate to this or am I just weird?
Content:
I'm scared of having a debate with any of my friends because I'm afraid that they'll use that as a reason to not bother with me anymore, like they've been looking for a valid reason to get away from me so they'll take any small argument as a reason to escape. Every time I get even into the smallest of debates, I'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if I didn't cause it or even if I'm right. I hate making people upset so I'd rather admit I'm wrong (even if I'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. I always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where I say what I actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because I'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real. Am I just spineless or is this something that others feel?

Post 282: I GOT ACCEPTED TO COLLEGE!!
Content:
I got my first acceptance letter today!!! High school was a pretty shit experience for me. Anxiety held me back and lead to me missing things like football games and prom. It got so bad that I had to get home tutors for two years because I couldn‚Äôt even manage to leave my house. For awhile I considered dropping out because I literally believed it was impossible to continue. But I couldn‚Äôt be more proud right now. I‚Äôm IN school for senior year, I WILL be attending my graduation ceremony, and I AM GOING TO COLLEGE!!! Hell yeah!!! So if anyone feels like giving up, trust me if I can get into college with my attendance record looking the way it is, you can do pretty much anything.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who took time to share your experiences and congratulations. It means so much and it‚Äôs encouraging to no end. You all are such lovely peopleüíôüíô

Post 283: Does anyone else unconsciously sigh constantly to calm themselves down and accidentally worry people/piss them off
Content:
I live around Koreans who think sighing is rude, and other people have mentioned that I sigh a lot especially when I am stressed, but it doesn't mean I am upset necessarily or displeased with the person I am with, I just do that to help myself think more clearly and get rid of the anxious feeling/dread in my chest and stomach. It usually works for a bit and then I have to do it again a few minutes later. I was not conscious that I did this until I moved to Korea and got scolded for doing this. Not doing it is almost unbearable physiologically though - I feel like I have to do it to release the sensation in my chest and stomach. Am I the only one?

I was in my AP Psychology class today (Wednesday‚Äôs are online days so the school can clean) and my teacher said she wouldn‚Äôt be checking the chat because it gets too confusing. She started playing a video with a horrible echo and kids tried telling her in the chat, and I wanted to work up the courage to turn my mic on to tell her. I was shaking so bad, so I took a sip of water and quickly pressed the button thinking ‚ÄúOK I TURNED IT ON ITS NOW OR NEVER‚Äù and I told her and answered her questions and it GOT FIXED!! She even thanked me at the end of class for being the one to speak up. I‚ÄôM SO HAPPY!!!

I've been thinking about it so much lately: who could I have been if my anxiety wasn't constantly altering my decisions? I am in my mid 30s and I feel like I've wasted my life. I'm so ashamed of it. Which, of course, only gives me more anxiety. 

DAE feel this?

Post 290: After bombing at my working interview last week due to panic attacks, I got a second chance with an even better business in a similar role today. I decided to have fun with the interview and it was low-stress and anxiety. I GOT THE JOB.
Content:
I am seriously over the moon right now!  This is my DREAM JOB and I can't believe I scored it!  I followed the advice y'all gave me after my last interview and had a "fake it till you make it" approach to all interactions with this employer.  I made dog puns in my first e-mail, joked a bit on the phone, and made the whole process fun for myself (which, it turns out, made it fun for everyone else too!).  My anxiety is going to be much, much lower now knowing 1) that I actually have a full time job, 2) that I'll be doing what I love, and 3) It's less than 15 minutes from my new home.

What will I be doing, you ask?  Working with DOGS!  I love, Love, LOVE dogs and have worked professionally with them for a couple of years previously.  I'll mostly be playing with them in small groups, although there will be cleaning and bathing as required (I love giving them baths!).

I feel the complete *opposite* of what I felt going into that second interview at last week.  In every way.  I'm confident, too...  That's rare for me.  Thanks, anxiety.  Seriously, though...  Thank YOU, r/anxiety!  I approached this opportunity today using the tips and advice you gave me...  And it worked beautifully!

I start tomorrow at 11 AM.  Wish me luck!!!  :D

I believe mine does. Every little mistake was the end of the world for my single mother who raised me and my siblings. I used to think it was normal to be screamed at and grounded for spilling stuff on the floor as a kid. Until now, as an adult I think it is pretty crazy how my mothers anger could go 0 to 100 that fast over children making stupid mistakes. And yes, I stopped telling my mother about details of my life due to the explosions that would commence. Sucks.

Reading all your comments has been comforting, but also heartbreaking knowing there are so many of us that struggle with something that seems so simple(being around other humans) I went to bed last night feeling very defeated as I gave into my anxiety yet again and bailed on a social event to stay home and be alone. However, I woke up this morning to see all these responses and they honestly made me emotional because now I see so many people struggling with this same thing! There is probably ppl even in my own apartment building that feel this way and I can‚Äôt reach them! I can‚Äôt find them because of my anxiety holding me back. This viscous cycle has to be broken....

Post 297: Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety.
Content:
25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won‚Äôt like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can‚Äôt really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn‚Äôt make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone‚Äôs reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don‚Äôt let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don‚Äôt waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can‚Äôt be trusted anyways.

You don‚Äôt need to respond to anything immediately, you don‚Äôt need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn‚Äôt think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn‚Äôt matter and it‚Äôs OK for people to be wrong!

So take a load off your mind and don‚Äôt let your imagination get the best of you.

Post 298: My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life
Content:
It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used. If y'all can trust yourself, it can make the difference

Post 304: Stop the benzo fearmongering please
Content:
Yes, benzos can be addictive.

Yes, benzos can absolutely ruin your life if you abuse them.

Yes, benzos can have side effects.

But there are millions of people who responsibly use benzos to treat anxiety, panic attacks, etc and significantly benefit from them (myself included) I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts here about people claiming to have taken one benzo and having a massive reaction from them or some equally crazy story about someone taking like 5mg every time. All it does is promote fear and scare people who could benefit from them.

I‚Äôm not a proponent of putting anyone on benzos unless they are extremely disciplined about it and don‚Äôt have any addictive tendencies and am aware of the dangers but please stop the fear mongering.

Edit: I want to amend this post by saying, if your doctor prescribed you for daily use, I am so sorry. I think doctors who prescribe for daily use are irresponsible. Benzos are a blessing for emergencies but imo should not be taken daily and the doctors who prescribe for daily use should get their licenses taken away. To those who got addicted from negligent docs, I am sorry.

I just wanted to say that it‚Äôs more than ok to start your day later. Some days are like that. It‚Äôs hard to find motivation especially when the anxiety is really bad. So do something you enjoy first. Like self care. My self care today is ice cream and going to a park and reading a book. Yay for getting dressed and getting out of the house despite dreading it. It wasn‚Äôt so bad and now I will do dishes, pat myself on the back, and call it a productive day so I can go binge watch a show. What do you guys do for self care or to get yourself moving on harder days? I‚Äôd love to hear about it. Sending good vibes!


EDIT: I don‚Äôt know how edits work I guess I just write in here? Thank you so so much for everyone who interacted with this post and shared their story. This is a wonderful community and you‚Äôre all doing great! And thank you so so much for the award.

Post 313: Does anyone else get anxiety about getting older and aging??
Content:
I know there is nothing we can do about it but I still can‚Äôt wrap my head around it that we just grow old and die.

Post 314: Anyone else panic when someone near them is angry or possibly angry?
Content:
I notice that when someone in the same space as me is angry or shows signs of anger, I become extremely on edge. I start to shake, I get the urge to cry or run/hide and I go completely mute, unable to look that person in the eye or talk to them, kind of in fear of getting in their way and having them take it out on me (though not always). Something as small as that person sighing really loudly, or someone slamming or dropping something sends me into a panic. It takes me a really long time to calm down too. I assume this is from my social anxiety? But I haven‚Äôt heard of this in anyone else with social anxiety. I keep googling it but each time I end up with nothing, so I decided to ask/post here. Is this an anxiety disorder thing? Do other people experience this? Or am I just weird? :/
Edit: I wasn‚Äôt expecting this to become so popular. Thank you all for sharing your experiences. You made me feel less alone, and I hope my post made all of you feel the same.

I was so nervous that my foot was shaking on the gas pedal. I almost chickened out and didn't even go today, but I'm glad I did! Just came here to say that I am proud of myself for finally doing it and to let you guys know that you can do it too!




Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!

Post 318: Anyone else wake up hours early for things only to lay awake doing absolutely nothing for as long as possible?
Content:
I can‚Äôt believe I never put 2 and 2 together and thought of this as a way that my anxiety manifests. For as long as I can remember I have done this, I like to wake up super early for things and just lay there doing nothing because I feel like sleeping all the way until the stressful event is too fast and if I just lay there awake I can savor every second that I have of not doing the thing. 

I used to do this every morning before work when I had a job I didn‚Äôt like. I did it all the time for school especially in middle school. I just did it for my first day of classes this semester and I‚Äôm a senior in college. Woke up at like 3:30 for no reason and never even tried to go back to sleep. Just laid there under my blanket trying to keep my mind as blank as possible and enjoy the nothingness before my day. 

Also, sorry if this has been posted a million times, anxiety is something I‚Äôve long been diagnosed with but I have always avoided it and only now am I starting to try to share about it and confront it little by little.

Post 319: Does anyone else feel like they're constantly in a rush to get things done even when they have nothing else they want to do?
Content:
I don't know if this is anxiety linked or not but Ive always has this sense to rush things. I always want to get things done and completed, even enjoyable things sometimes. 

Like I want to move on to the next thing or I just want to finish things so I can relax.

But then when I have nothing to do I don't have anything I even want to do. I feel like it's really hard for me to just enjoy what I'm doing whether it's good or bad, work or fun, etc. 

I've read of "Hurry Sickness" but it feels like that matches people that are actually busy and want to do more things. Im not really a busy person, it's like I'm in a rush to get back to doing nothing.

Post 320: I am so proud of myself and I need to tell someone
Content:
Two years ago I was too scared to leave my house. 

Today I decided to visit my dad an apply for an internship abroad. 

To visit my dad I have to travel by train for eight hours. Two years ago I couldn't get on the bus to go to college.

The internship will be ten weeks long. Two years ago I had panic attacks about going into the garden. 

I feel so extremely proud of myself, even if my family and friends don't understand. I'm starting to be myself again, even though I was never adventurous. 

I finally feel okay doing things on my own.


Edit: First off all I want to thank all of you for the kind words and awards. I woke up this morning and was greated with so many kind and lovely responses. 

I've seen quite a lot of people asking about how I got here. The thing is, I don't have a simple answer (although I guess the answer to anxiety is never simple).

If it wasn't for my lovely SO I wouldn't have gotten this far. At one point he said: I want to go on holiday. We don't have to be gone for long, we don't have to go far away. You can choose the location and if you just want to hang around the hotelroom every day that's fine. But I need a break from daily life. 

I spent most of the holiday in the hotel but I did go for a few walks. Having a panic attack in a different country feels different; the people who see you will never see you again, so it took away some of the shame aspect for me. 

After that summer college started again. I hadn't gone much the year before but I talked to my teachers and they allowed me to repeat the year. I didn't dare to take the bus (my anxiety is centered around being locked up) so I cycled to college every day for a while. 

When the weather got colder I realized I didn't want to cycle 13 kilometres through the snow so I tried going by bus. Not going anywhere, just getting in and seeing how many stops I could survive.

So, I kind of did exposure therapy on myself. I eventually got through the waiting list of a psychologist but by then I could go out by myself. After she went away for pregnancy leave I just pushed myself further and further. 

SO and I moved house in April to a cheap but lovely appartment in a lovely neighbourhood in a small village. I finally feel a bit at peace and I think that caused my sudden progress. 

This probably won't really help anyone as seeing a  professional probably is better than doing it all by yourself. I am just lucky enough to have my SO for support, even if he will never understand how important he was in this process.

Post 323: I did it üòä
Content:
I have agoraphobia. My therapist took me to a coffee place, and we sat for an hour. I was tense and shaky, but no panic attacks!! I was able to keep calm and carry a conversation. First time I've been able to sit in a place and not feel like I'm at a high anxiety level in over a year. I'm quietly proud of myself, so I just wanted to share üòä

I know some might think that's not a big step, and it's not but that's okay. Small steps are just as important, because I'm still going forward üíú

Post 324: I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do
Content:
I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

Edit: Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it. I called some people and have a job interview this friday at a place I like

Edit 2: Wow this really blew up huh, again, thank you so much for your nice comments. I've read all of them and I am speechless. Also a big thanks to the person who gave this post platinum, I appreciate it very much. I don't really know what to say, this community is so kind. Thank you 

Post 325: Does anyone else occasionally have "Time anxiety"?
Content:
Time anxiety as in having anxiety that you won't ever have enough time to do something specific. In my case, I always get anxious when my wife has me run to the store or go to an appointment mainly because I fear I won't have enough time to do things that I wanna do even going as far as to get annoyed in my head when I'm told to let the dog out after work...

&#x200B;

I am happy to have plenty of free time once I'm off from work, about 6 hours till I go to sleep so 5-6 hours of me doing what I want but when something simple like letting the dog out, shaving, cleaning a bathroom comes up I get anxiety thinking oh crap I'm, not gonna have enough time to do what I wanna do....how can you get past this? It's obviously silly to me because doing all that takes very little time and when i do have free time I spend it watching tv and hardly doing anything productive...

&#x200B;

I want to get up go to the gym, Read a book, go play with my dog but i always get this anxiety that i guess something will happen so I choose to spend my time resting incase i need my energy for something else...

I cant tell if this is overdramatic or adorable, but I got this beautiful baby boy the other day, and hes just so sweet and wonderful. Lately at times I've felt a lack of empathy and alot of anxiety, but when I saw him I thought of how small he is and how I cant wait to be a dad. And I had a ton of anxiety regarding whether I set up his safe room well and if I would do something wrong and all that. All is going well so far, but just sitting here with him seeing how beautiful he is, and releazing how much I really do love him, I've just been crying my eyes out. Idk if this is weird or not. Regardless, I'm happy to welcome home my little Why Not. His names Ollyüíô

Content:
I already feel like a burden to everyone around me, so whenever someone criticizes me of a relatively small thing (justly) I spiral into this pit where I think that I'm making other people's lives worse by being a piece of shit. Drinking two cups of coffee in the morning probably didn't help either... üòÖ

Any tips on how to shake this feeling off?

Post 332: I was the only student to join the video chat this morning.
Content:
Since we transitioned to online classes, my Spanish professor still wanted to meet with us so we could continue to practice speaking Spanish. When we first started doing this, I wondered what would happen if only one person showed up, and now I know. 

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words. It made me feel a little more confident and if I stay focused, I think I'll be able to get a lot of my schoolwork done today. I have two assignments due later today and I feel confident that I'm gonna get them done and turned in today.

Post 335: Does anyone else feel most of their anxiety would dissipate if society would just lay off?
Content:
The majority of my anxiety is driven by societal expectations. I don't have a license because I hate driving...an expectation that didn't even exist before the 1900s. I hated school and struggle with work because I constantly feel I'm not smart enough for the task. I hate money and insurance because I never have enough. I hate appointments and social gatherings because people expect me to appear normal and put-together. I hate this century because I feel like a wild animal that is expected to pay taxes instead of thriving in nature and foraging for food.

"Just exercise". "Keep yourself busy". "Its all in your head, just tell yourself you're fine". "I know you feel like youre having a heart attack, have you tried to meditate it away?"

I cannot fix a chemical imbalance in my brain as easy as you fucking people make it sound like I can. Sometimes it gets bad enough to be seemingly out of my control. Your lack of good advice and your bullshit quick-fixes do not help at all.

"I give you options and you shoot them down without trying them".  

You ever consider you're not the first to suggest it? Making me feel like shit during a panic attack really helps, eh?

Post 342: I've learned that one of the best ways to overcome anxiety is to listen and take care of your body. It is the only boss.
Content:
I'm 25F and I have anxiety. Obsessive and intrusive thoughts. Panic. Paranoia. Constant worry. Incapacity of joy and calmness. All this in a loop. All of this makes me forget about my body. So it accumulates a huge amount of stress.

When my body is relaxed, my mind follows it.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

Run.

Ride a bicycle.

Cry.

Walk on the rain.

Get a massage.

Feel the wind on your face.

Get a sweet hug from a loved one.



Your mind will follow.

Cashier would gladly help explaining the menu, and it's not a big deal at all.

Post 344: When you‚Äôre so used to feeling anxious that being calm and relaxed feels like a high
Content:
I‚Äôve been feeling very calm and relaxed recently, and because I was so accustomed to confusion and worry, mainly due to not having a clue how to behave socially and being fearful of having a meltdown whenever I‚Äôm at work and people all talk at me at once, being in such a calm state felt like, to me, I was high. As in, stoned or dosed up on benzos. I should mention I didn‚Äôt actually take anything. Who else has noticed this? It made me realise how intrusive and disruptive anxiety actually is, and that despite letting it exist, it‚Äôs way too much of a plastic bag over my head to ignore, which is why I am going to make more of an effort to counter it instead of living with it.

Post 350: It‚Äôs honestly baffling to me that there are people who approach new experiences without crippling fear
Content:
Seriously. I got a new job and I had my first real task earlier this week. And I spent the *entire* week in and out of anxiety attacks. Couldn‚Äôt get out of bed. But also couldn‚Äôt sleep. I felt physically ill and wanted to vomit but I couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt eat anything except some bread that I forcefed myself just so that I could take antacids. And all I could do was sob uncontrollably and think of how much I want to die. 

Then the work task I had been dreading happened, and...my symptoms just melted away. It was almost magical. I felt so relieved but also so incredibly stupid. I *knew* nothing seriously bad could happen, that even the worst case scenario was pretty alright. But my body was just convinced I was going to die. It‚Äôs like my nervous system is a mechanical bull without an off switch and all I can do is hang on for dear life while it knocks me around and tires itself out. No chance at conversation or understanding, just mindless panic. 

All I want is to punch my anxiety in the face and yell ‚Äúcan we at least talk about this?‚Äù

My anxiety is partly linked to my extreme emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and for those of you who don't know about it, it ruins every aspect of my life, to the point where if I get the slightest stomach pain or uncomfortable feeling ill panic, which results in me having stomach pains all the time, and sometimes, maybe once a month or so I'll come across feeling awful, with crippling stomach pains and end up on the toilet for half an hour with poop coming out like a faucet, does anyone else experience diarrhea along with their anxiety?

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

I just want to take a moment to thank everyone who has taken the time to share such love in this thread. Thank you so much. I am often hesitant to write my feelings out for fear of being judged but I have learned that it also helps me heal.  Thank you again, you and you're family stay healthy.

Content:
This is going to sound so weird, which is why I really want to see if anyone else feels like this. 

I have awful anxiety and always plan out my routine with at least an hour gap of having to get somewhere. But when the time comes to actually leave the house, I... can‚Äôt? Like the ability to get out of bed, to put clothes on, take my pills, to ensure I put some sort of substance into my body... is exhausting and I keep putting it off until I‚Äôm literally so late that it makes me hate myself even more. But yet the consequences of my actions aren‚Äôt as anxiety inducing now that I realize that I‚Äôm late? 

I lay there like ‚Äúoh I should leave in 10 minutes but I haven‚Äôt even gotten up... what is the point?‚Äù and then drag myself out of bed, cursing myself for giving in. 

And then the entire time I‚Äôm on my way there, my depression hits and I‚Äôm beating myself up because DUH, I‚Äôm awfully late and now the other party who told me a time to meet up has to wait for my sad, pathetic self to show up. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me and I don‚Äôt think this is normal? Can anyone relate or am I crazy?

Post 358: Does anyone get an uncontrollable amount anxiety before going to bed knowing you have to wake up for work?
Content:
No matter what I do, I always feel sick to my stomach anxious knowing I gotta go to work the next morning. 

Fast forward to the next morning, I‚Äôm still anxious, I barely slept. 

I don‚Äôt smoke, barely drink but I wanna feel comfortable again.

**Edit**
I didn‚Äôt think this would get as much response as it did. 

I‚Äôve watched my father suffer from severe panic attacks for the last 15 years. He had to retire early and it took years for him to get disability. 

I watched him every morning with crippling anxiety to where he throws up. He doesn‚Äôt even have to leave the house, as soon as he wakes up he‚Äôs sick. He‚Äôs been on Xanax for 10-12 years probably. It‚Äôs the only thing that helps him. 

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks. 

Anxiety and panic attacks are an internal monster that break people down until they have nothing. It‚Äôs crappy, but true. 

Thank you for listening to my story and replying and liking it even. 

If anyone ever needs someone to talk to, I‚Äôm always here to talk!

Post 359: Anyone here get this ‚Äúopposite of social anxiety‚Äù situation where you talk your lungs out whenever you‚Äôre with people to distract yourself from your internal anxiety struggles and because of loneliness?
Content:
Side note: when I‚Äôm alone, I find a way to just essentially spam text in group chats because I feel like my mind has to be occupied by something somewhat enjoyable to cope.

When people don‚Äôt answer quickly, I just quickly assume they‚Äôre being busy and productive with their time which makes me feel like shit.

Edit: this is definitely social anxiety but just a different way of coping with it than what one would figure from someone having social anxiety

Post 360: Had anxiety for years and I finally plucked up enough courage to apply for a job and I got it, I am now building up money to move to London, fuck anxiety and depression will NOT take my life
Content:
Been in a bad way the past couple of years, stuck in a rut with no light at the end of the tunnel. There‚Äôs been many times I  contemplated suicide.

The other day I just thought fuck it I‚Äôm making something of myself, so step 1 of that was contributing to society (get a job), step 2 is to move to a better area somewhere I can feel more happy and fulfilled.

Still not out of the woods yet but I‚Äôm trying given the terrible circumstances.

Of course I am anxious and scared still of the uncertainty, I hear the horrible voice saying ‚Äòeverything will fail‚Äô ‚Äònothing will work out for you‚Äô

London will be a fresh start for me, whilst I‚Äôm at it I might even change my name and identity lol

Post 361: I hate when I get anxious over making a phone call and then the person doesn't pick up
Content:
Just how dare they?

I have spent an hour preparing. I have done breathing exercises to calm myself down and not cry. I prepared my bed for the ease of running away and hiding in it as soon as the phone call is done. I rehearsed my opening line and all possible outcomes. I considered just not calling, but told myself "NO this is important, you can do this!"

I finally press the call button and the signal sound makes me even more anxious. I keep breathing and rehearsing.

And then they just... don't pick up.

**The audacity** (of this absolutely random and unaware of my suffering person)

Post 362: I called out of work and gave myself a mental health day!
Content:
I really struggle to prioritize my own wellbeing when it comes to work. I'm really scared of being seen as a bad employee. I started a new job a few months ago and it's been incredibly stressful. My anxiety is at an all-time high. So I called out today to give myself a little break. I'm really proud of myself for prioritizing my mental health. Of course, a part of me feela guilty, but I'm trying to redirect my thoughts.

Post 364: Does anybody else get really anxious from hearing a phone ring or even vibrate?
Content:
I've just found the song *"Internet Friends"* by Knife Party, which has a phone vibrating in it. I hate using phones to begin with, and it vibrating reminds freaks me out. Nobody should be calling me, so it must be bad. Does anybody else feel this way from a vibrating sound?

Edit: Glad to know I'm not alone in this feeling. Also, a bonus for you: I once used my house phone to call my mobile phone to make sure it was working, and even holding the two phones was enough to raise my heart-rate, I have no idea why.

Post 365: I reported the doctor who implied I was lying about Anxiety.
Content:
Today after about 4 weeks of sitting on the idea I finally reported the doctor who implied I was lying about Anxiety in an attempt to get out of work while getting paid. 

What that asshole doesn't know is 1.) I was authorized time off for my anxiety and did not need a doctor's note from him. I was genuinely seeking help and 2.) I got a second opinion from someone who took mental health more serious who gave me a doctor's note to stay out of work for 2 weeks and gave me the suggestion to talk to a therapist. 

I return to my new doctor at the end of next week to see if more time is needed or if medication needs to be prescribed for my anxiety and depression. 

Nothing may come of my complaint but, at least I did it!

Edit: I wanted to say I love that this is the the post that got me my first award ever! I also wanted to Thank /u/inevitable_Problem85 as they are the person who told me I should report him!

Post 366: It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.
Content:
I only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like "hmmm. Not me." 

&#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.


EDIT: I just wanna say thank you all for the kind comments and well wishes! It's so nice to find other people who can relate to what you're going through. I wish you all the best in your own personal journeys as well. 

Post 367: Does anyone else's stomach get messed up by anxiety?
Content:
I've been crazy stressed this week and have been getting a lot of stomach aches. Then last night, these awful stomach cramps started and they still haven't gone away. At this point I'm honestly not sure if it's anxiety or if I'm constipated lol. Though I'm more inclined to say it's anxiety because the pain seems to vanish the moment I stop feeling anxious, and then comes back when I start thinking about it again. No fun :(

So here is how my anxiety disorder looks like: your mum sends you a photo of the dog walking, with no caption. The leash looks like it broke on the photo so you call her. She doesn‚Äôt answer. You automatically go into a panic thinking the dog run away and got hit by a car and now your mum is panicking and that is why she doesn‚Äôt answer her phone so you keep calling and calling and crying and struggling to breathe until she eventually answers, and it was just the sun reflecting on the photo and the leash is fine and your dog is fine and everyone is fine, but you are now drained and just want to go hide under the covers and recuperate.

Post 372: To anyone else who's having a self sabotage day
Content:
This goes out to everyone who's spent the day laying in your bed, scrolling theough reddit for the past 8 hours because you can't handle today, or don't have the motivation to get up. To everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have.

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. 

Cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this. 

Edit: This post blew up more than I thought! I wish I could reply to all of you, but I'm super busy prepping for exams (that's right, today's not a self sabotage day like yesterday). I feel so happy that what I've said has helped people. S/o to the awesome community here, and to my fellow anxiety sufferers for being so welcoming and supportive to each other. Let's make today great!

Post 373: I am too sensitive for this world
Content:
Does anyone else just break down crying whenever they make the smallest mistake? I am so worried about never being good enough that anytime I do something wrong or can‚Äôt figure something out, the tears start coming. I feel like I have absolutely no control over my emotions and it‚Äôs humiliating me. I started crying in class, in front of my supervisor, and in public, all for reasons that seem so small in retrospect. But when I start crying I get so embarrassed that it makes me cry even more. My dad told me I need to grow a thicker skin and my supervisor told me my body language is always aloof and uncaring when I‚Äôm turning away to avoid making eye contact to try and stop the tears. I can‚Äôt seem to win. I can‚Äôt even check my email anymore because I‚Äôm so afraid to see someone saying I‚Äôve done something wrong. I don‚Äôt feel as if I was made to fit into this world where I can‚Äôt even be told I‚Äôm not doing good enough without completely breaking down. What can I even do? I feel like I‚Äôve lost all control of my life.

Post 374: whoever you are, I love you.

the panic will subside, I promise you. take in deep breaths and remember that you are loved and appreciated. above all, you are strong, and a short-lived bout of anxiety won‚Äôt and can‚Äôt kill you, you beautiful, beautiful human being.

again, I love you. take care.

Post 375: Does anyone else feel like they're constantly doing something wrong but nobody's telling them what it is?
Content:
That's the best way I can put it. When people are nice to me I convince myself it's forced, someone has asked them to do it/they are obligated to do it, and that I'm constantly making mistakes but people aren't telling me to spare my feelings. 

It borders on paranoia and is very overwhelming, I just constantly fear having made some sort of mistake/making someone mad and that nobody is telling me about it. It's a daily occurrence for me to have this thought process.

Is that weird? Am I alone in this?

Post 376: Is there anyone else here that makes themselves physically sick (such as vomiting, heartburn, etc) because of their anxiety?
Content:
Hi,

I‚Äôm new here and I guess I just hope I‚Äôm not the only one that deals with this. I‚Äôm diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety.  I‚Äôve been making myself physically sick the past week over going to a bridal shower on the weekend. The reason I have the anxiety is just the fear of being judged by others or saying something stupid.  I‚Äôve even been in group therapy (iOP) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but I just feel  like I took a step back. Yesterday, I was so stressed out about this that I caused myself to vomit even; I‚Äôve had a migraine, some random nausea, and heartburn the last week due to the stress and anxiety too. Is there anyone else who has this happen?

Post 377: I did it! I asked for a girls number today.
Content:
I'm a junior in college, and I've never dated or even kissed a girl because of my Social Anxiety Disorder holding me back. I was officially diagnosed at the age of 15, and whenever I tried to date, I could never go through with it. I would seldom try to talk to girls about dating seriously, and when I did, I usually canceled or just chickened out.

But today I was feeling good, I think I had done pretty well at an Exam I was studying all week for, and it was almost the weekend.  I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self "Screw it, I'm doing it" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.

I asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!

UPDATE: I texted her some, but she seldom replied, and even when she did, she didn't very interested. I don't think anything will come out of this, but this was a huge milestone for me and I'm proud of myself nonetheless!

Content:
I feel so selfish for this because I‚Äôve been lucky enough to be able to WFH and quarantine this entire time. 

At the beginning of shelter in place, I was too anxious to even be outside. But now that I‚Äôm comfortable going to parks, walking to the beach, hiking, etc., (I still don‚Äôt go shopping indoors) I absolutely am dreading going back to work and in-person college. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm using COVID as an excuse to socially isolate myself or if I‚Äôm genuinely still terrified of catching it/passing it, but I really love my new routine. 

I get to work on my own time without the awkward office chatter, don‚Äôt have to spend all day on campus being overly self-aware, I don‚Äôt feel obligated to attend social events, it‚Äôs honestly amazing. I‚Äôve gotten to work more on meditation & other anxiety coping strategies. I feel so awful for the way I feel because this has been such a difficult & stressful time for so many people.

Post 384: PLEASE DONT POST ABOUT YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT!!!
Content:
My mom posted several times on her Facebook talking about my recent hospital (psych ward) stay. (I‚Äôm 19, was 18 at the time, like it matters anyway, you shouldn‚Äôt post anyone‚Äôs personal info on social media whether they are your kid as a minor or not) Luckily she didn‚Äôt mention the psych ward part but I asked her to take it down because it‚Äôs private and no ones business but my own and my doctors but she didn‚Äôt so I had to resort to publicly commenting;

‚ÄúMom, please take this down. As I said in person I would really prefer it and strongly ask that you dont talk about my mental health or my issues on your Facebook with people whom I don‚Äôt know. I love you, and no offense to anyone who‚Äôs read this post, but this information is private about me and I do not like that it has been shared without my consent. I understand your concerned for me, but this is no ones business but my own and my doctors. Thank you all for the well wishes, and have a blessed day.‚Äù 

Hopefully the embarrassment will get her to take it the fuck down. And before you ridicule me I did what I thought necessary. She needs to learn her place. She can‚Äôt go spouting my shit to everyone she meets. I won‚Äôt tolerate that shit. I‚Äôm not a minor any more, I‚Äôm a grown ass adult, and if I didn‚Äôt live in her house still she wouldn‚Äôt know a damn thing about me anymore. This shit is why I have trust issues.

Edit;
Of course she bitch at me about it and said ‚Äútake down whatever you want to take down. I‚Äôm done with it.‚Äù 
I dont care at this point. I did what I had to do.

It‚Äôs the worst week ever at university. Syllabus week. The week where everyone has to introduce themselves. I had to do it twice and each time my voice didn‚Äôt shake when usually it does. This is such a big deal for me. Cause I‚Äôm always embarrassed by how my voice shakes at first when introducing myself to others or talking in front of a large group. 

Post 386: I'm quitting my job due to anxiety. I feel like a failure.
Content:
The day has finally come. After six years of teaching, I know I need to quit. My acid reflux and insomnia have gotten so bad that I feel like dying most days. People keep telling me to hang in there - that teaching gets better with time and experience. But it only keeps getting worse for me. The racing thoughts are ceaseless.

Now I need to figure out how to tell my supervisor. I know it's going to be a huge disappointment to him. He needs me. My school needs me. My students need me. But I need to put my health first now. I can't imagine what everyone is going to think of me. They will probably think I'm crazy or weak or both.

I've been looking for other jobs the past two years and haven't been able to find anything. I will be moving back home and living off of unemployment for as long as I can. Hopefully I can find something else soon.

Edit: Wow I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. I've never felt so seen and supported in my life (and I'm not just saying that). I wrote this post as a "let me just get these bad feelings out and send them out into the universe" type of thing, never thinking I would get so much love in return. You are all amazing people and you are all FIGHTERS - not failures. You have helped me see that I am not a failure either, and I wish I could give each and every one of you a hug. I wish all of you the happiness and health that life has to offer. Thank you x a million.

My dog is my best friend,  after everyday of me being on leave due to my anxiety he was by my side supporting me, he loves me and I love him.  He‚Äôs the best dog in the world. 

Unfortunately he has a very crazy cancer that is spreading over his body. I ache for him and want to relieve him, but I am unsure how I am going to handle it.  He‚Äôs not a legal therapy dog, but is definitely my therapy.  

I don‚Äôt know what to do,  I am picking him up from icu tomorrow and bringing him home to die in peace in his favorite spot.  I am having him privately cremated and returned to me.  He is only 5 years old for Christ sake.  

[here is my boy](https://imgur.com/gallery/x2coH9C)


Edit:  I really appreciate all the support, we go to pick up my boy in a few hours from ICU at the university of Florida. It‚Äôs a long drive and I hope he makes it home okay.  We‚Äôve been all over trying to get him the best care and to save his life.   He has an awful pneumonia right now that refuses to heal due to the spreading cancer, so hearing him breath is very difficult.  I know what I am doing is the best for him, but it really doesn‚Äôt make me feel better.  I am constantly wishing they‚Äôd magically call me and tell me he‚Äôs okay, as stupid as that sounds.   He‚Äôs scheduled to be put down at 4pm est at home with me by his side his whole time.  [here is my favorite picture of him](https://imgur.com/gallery/6F9wtXG)

Edit 2: he‚Äôs in the car with me. I‚Äôm reading him all your comments   I can tell he likes them

Final edit: Arthas passed away at 4:15pm est at his home surrounded by the people who loved him more than he could possibly know.  I love you boy. I‚Äôll miss you forever.  [Rest in peace Arthas](https://imgur.com/gallery/Mq9zQMK)

Tonight is a win for all of us. It‚Äôs proof that we can get over these mental barriers from anxiety  if we let ourselves. It‚Äôs a hard fight, but tonight more than one battle was won.

Someone has the audacity to comment and tell me to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù because I‚Äôm in college now. I can‚Äôt tell you how much that pissed me off. 

Okay, miss rising high school junior, why don‚Äôt you take my social anxiety and depression with you? See how it feels and how difficult it is to simply ‚Äúget over it‚Äù. Social anxiety is a real mental health issue. Jesus Christ, you think being one of those ‚Äúchance me for college admissions, I take my studies seriously‚Äù people would actually have a brain cell and some empathy.

Post 395: Anyone else get the urge to just leave everything behind and go live in a log cabin in the mountains?
Content:
Lately ive become more and more unsure what i want from my life, and everytime I feel sad, mad or deprived of energy i just wanna pack my shit and go, its mostly a coping mechanism i think, but its also way more. I fantasize about living somewhere else or in a different reality, because i feel like i could never achieve an interesting life where i am now.  I know I have to start working towards something in order to feel fulfilled but since i have no idea what i want, i lose motivation soon enough. And thus i get stuck in this cycle of mediocrity, of understanding what i need to do, but not a reason as to why to do it. 

At this point im not even sure wether iv ever had or still have depression/anxiety/mental illness, i just know that since i was a kid ive never ever felt fullfilled. The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

And lately it seems all the rest i get is from ether being asleep or getting drunk/high and finally getting rid of the annoyance that is being consience without purpose.

Dont worry about substance abuse because even though im without purpose, for some reason my mind wont let me get addicted to something it knows is bad. So i guess subconsciously im still hoping for a better future.

I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole "comparison" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a "real" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

Edit: thank you for all the kind comments, and for the gold ‚ù§Ô∏è

Post 402: For whoever needs to hear this, it will be okay.
Content:
For anyone who needs to hear this, it will be okay. Whatever you are fearing right now will pass, just like everything you've feared in the past worked itself out on its own. Things may not go the way you expect them, and that's okay. That's the way life is for everyone. But everything will work itself out in the end. You will find a job, you will get that degree, you will find love, you will be successful, the terrible thing you are worried about will probably not happen, and even if something unexpected does occur you are 100% strong enough to get through it. You are stronger than you think and you will be okay. There is nothing wrong with you. You are not weird or a loser or a stereotype. You are not ugly or bad or defective. You are so much more. You are a flawed but beautiful human soul who is  so much more valuable and complex than anyone around you could ever comprehend. You are okay and you are going to be okay.

Post 403: I got through my job interview without having a panic attack!
Content:
It took some help from my meds but I answered all the questions and my interviewer seemed to like me. Here‚Äôs hoping they say yes!

Post 404: Didn't have a panic attack this morning!
Content:
I tend to have them each morning or if I wake up in the middle of the night (because I have to pee LOL) and I managed to keep my anxiety in check!! It's kinda exciting.

EDIT:  
Thank you so much for the gold!! I hope everyone has a great day!! <3

Post 405: Anxiety is having to leave for work at a certain time even though you know you‚Äôre still going to be 30 minutes early
Content:
I‚Äôm done with this 

Post 406: I just found out about the 3-3-3 Rule and cried out of happiness because it changed everything.
Content:
I'm prone to anxiety attacks and handle them well but lately between moving and HRT they've been terrifyingly worse.
I just learned 3-3-3: Name 3 things you see, 3 things you hear, then move 3 parts of your body.
My attacks almost instantly go away, if you have never heard of this try it. It snaps your brain back to reality, and I had so much doubt while learning how to do it that it working so well legit caught me off guard.

Post 407: A stranger destroyed all my confidence.
Content:
I was standing in line for food and this woman her mother and her boyfriend came up behind me and asked if i was in line, i said a simple "oh, yeah" pointed at the line, went back to fiddling on my phone to ease my anxiety. And thus began the fifteen minute barrage of degrading comments. She made fun of my voice, the way i stood, i leaned against a wall and she made fun of it. I tried texting someone about the pinch i was in and she made fun of me for texting so much. By the time i finally got to order i could hardly speak because i was on the verge of throwing up. The whole time she made fun of me i was just hanging my head pretending not to hear...im never going back there again even though it was my favorite place to eat. When i leave the house now i feel so small and worthless. Everything she said was all the "silly" things my anxiety constantly nagged me about that I constantly assured myself nobody cared about. That stranger destroyed my confidence, i have no desire to go anywhere

Post 408: I no longer have suicidal thoughts
Content:
Well actually I haven‚Äôt had it for maybe weeks now, not since January or early February. In my head, what started off as a thoughts of how to kill myself if I reach my suicidal phase turns into a ‚ÄúI want to die.‚Äù But I realize that I can‚Äôt kill myself, because I can‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs not in me, it‚Äôs in my head but it doesn‚Äôt tell me to do it. I never attempted it and can‚Äôt even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it‚Äôs not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I‚Äôm a coward, I couldn‚Äôt end the pain of living so I have to live like you‚Äôre half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn‚Äôt cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell. Despite all of that odds, I‚Äôm still here. Not living fully, but still breathing, that‚Äôs a plus for me I guess, I am crawling but I am moving slowly. I went to sleep that night and give myself a smile in the dark because why not? It‚Äôs a command given by a brain, but a smile. Maybe I‚Äôll read a book, idk.

Post 409: Currently at the movies alone for the first time in my life. I‚Äôm kind of freaking out with my hands shaking but I‚Äôm also a bit proud I‚Äôm doing it - going to the movies alone has been something I‚Äôd always wanted to do but been too anxious and self-conscious to do
Content:
Okay so it‚Äôs in a city 2.5 hours away from where I live so it‚Äôs a bit of cheating, as what‚Äôs put me off doing it before is seeing someone I know lol, and I am doing it to distract myself from not eating today...but I‚Äôm still doing it! I‚Äôm still super self-conscious about it but I‚Äôm not bailing..yet anyway.

I‚Äôm pathetic I know lol, but there‚Äôs not many other places I can post about it, so here I am haha

Edit: Thanks for all the kind comments! I really enjoyed the movie and I‚Äôm glad I went! :)

Post 410: Shoulders tense? Jaw clenched? Chest tight? You deserve better. Take a deep breath, let it go, and feel those shoulders droop, jaw muscles unclench, and chest open.
Content:
Take a breath slowly, fully (belly-chest-head), and as comfortably as possible, and let it out the same way. Repeat this for a minute or as long as you need, and you will feel better. Try to smile if you can because it does help a bit. If it's still tight, it helps to hold the tension (safely) on purpose, and then let the tension go as you exhale. For your chest try breathing in fully (belly-chest-head), holding it, and "squeezing" the air to your head. After a bit (10 seconds or so) let it go and feel the tension dissipate. You guys deserve this for toughing it out in this crazy time of our lives. You will get through, and here's a ritual to help you out. Whenever you want to dial it back a bit, go through these motions. Here's a virtual hug you guys.

Post 411: I finished a whole grilled cheese!
Content:
Lately my anxiety has been making it hard to eat full meals/meals at all. I‚Äôve been barely choking down 4 bites of food at meal times and trying to supplement with nutrition drinks, all while feeling sick and nauseous almost all the time, and waking up starving in the mornings while still unable to eat much of anything. Even my favorite foods would sound good in concept, but be nauseating once set in front of me. Plus I was wasting so much food just trying to eat anything, and I hate things going to waste.

But today my dad made me a grilled cheese for dinner and I ATE THE WHOLE THING! I could feel that terrible stomach feeling trying to overcome me every time I let my thoughts wander, but when that happened I would slow down and take deep breaths and remind myself that everything is ok, then try to distract myself in the dinner table conversation.

Anyways, it‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs the first full meal I‚Äôve been able to finish in weeks and I‚Äôm so happy I wanted to share.

Post 412: Hey
Content:
I just wanted to say happy new year to all the people in here who suffer from anxiety. I know it's such a hard thing to get over but we are the strong ones, anxiety can't take us away from our beautiful lives. Just keep fighting with it, we'll see better days in 2020. I love you all!

Post 413: I just shat myself during a panic attack. None of you can top this.
Content:
Felt an attack starting in the morning. Decided to take a couple of benzos and go upstairs. In the middle of the staircase, my legs gave out and I knelt on the steps. My bowels then decided this is the time to go. 

Spent the next half hour cleaning myself, but at least most people will never top this.‚úåüèº‚úåüèº 

...Yes I am ok now, but fuck this shit.

EDIT: God help me I got more awards than I've gotten in any alt ever for shitting my pants. You guys are beautiful.

Post 414: It‚Äôs exhausting to be an empathetic person with anxiety
Content:
As someone with pretty bad anxiety who also likes to keep up to date with the news and learn more about things to stay informed and try to be an ally, I find myself emotionally drained because this year is just so much. Is it better to avoid the news and social media when I‚Äôm feeling anxious? Because then I get anxiety about having the privilege to have the ability to just not pay attention to certain social justice issues. Either way this year sucks and my anxiety can‚Äôt handle it if it gets any worse.

Edit: Thank you so much for all the kindness and thoughtful responses. It really means a lot to me.

Post 415: Does anyone have a "hangover" period following a high-anxiety/stressful event?
Content:
Such as attending a concert, speaking in front of an audience, or anything that makes you nervous?

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically "shaky", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a "hangover" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Does anyone's body feel "shaken" after high excitement/stress events where it takes a while to recover?

Post 416: Has anyone else‚Äôs anxiety been kicking their fucking ass lately like what‚Äôs in the air????
Content:
Like literally I want to puke. Everyday. Why. So much healing. I can‚Äôt even go out literally. I just want to stay in my house. Sit in my room. Cook food. Maybe go outside IF it‚Äôs sunny.

Edit: also, does anyone eat their anxiety?? Is that a thing?

Edit #2: do you guys in the replies think maybe you‚Äôre being is sensitive than others? I consider myself a clairsentient empath, which is a nice gift and I‚Äôm grateful, but it also means that I am highly sensitive to other people‚Äôs energy. So my social anxiety is the one I struggle with most. I can feel. Every. Fucking. Thing. No joke. I can feel if someone looks at me, and throws a judgement my way. It‚Äôs like every time that I go out I have to put this huge mental shield around my body and focus on staying grounded, or it‚Äôs really challenging, so many things to feel, to process.

Post 417: Anxiety is trying to stop me from going to a car wash so I‚Äôm going to the car wash in an act of sheer disrespect towards anxiety
Content:
As the title says, I‚Äôve got ‚Äúa case of the spooks‚Äù where I feel woozy and dizzy and icky about just going to a car wash. As a kid I used to love going,  but now I find the chemically smell kind of difficult to manage. But the car is dirty and I want to do this. 

So now that anxiety has gotten involved, I want to be rude to it. So I‚Äôm gonna go get this car clean!

Edit: we got there and there was a line up of 5 cars ahead of us, so I had to double down on anticipatory anxiety too, but I WON. And the car is very pretty now!

Post 418: I presented to 80 people on Zoom!
Content:
It was scary at first but I made it through. I suffer from Social Anxiety and doing the 5 minute presentation to 80 people (that went well) made me more confident. When you finish it you think to yourself what the hell was I thinking beforehand, you really become more aware of the cognitive bias

Post 419: I was tearing up on a zoom call saying that I was having a rough past few days and my prof said...
Content:
‚Äúwell, just go get it done now. I want it done by the end of the afternoon. this is like FUN work for you! oh and, go take some deep breaths.‚Äù 

.... this is why I don‚Äôt even speak about my mental health. I can be on the verge of tears on a call with a professor, and their reply is to go do the work anyways. 

It‚Äôs disgusting and I wish professors would treat bad mental health like they would bad physical health. I am not doing well and it disappoints me every time when I remember that the world as a whole simply doesn‚Äôt care.

Post 420: Does anybody else have morning anxiety? It's just there the moment you wake up.
Content:
All the worries and problems of your life start popping in your head and makes your morning miserable.
The evenings before are relatively calm but the anxiety hits hard in the morning while you're still in bed.

Edit: Thank you all for the responses. Makes me feel that I'm not alone in this.
I really hope this passes for all of us.

Post 421: Reminder: Anxiety is suffering a simulation
Content:
The suffering is real but you're suffering a simulation. It's not real. 

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm "I'm actually safe except for XYZ" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - "I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

Edit: Jesus Christ this blew up. Thank you so much for all the awards. Replying will take time. Y'all know how it goes - up and down, excited, scared, happy, sad, the full range in an hour!

Post 422: Really missing the pre-COVID world when my severe anxiety was just cuz of regular trauma lmao
Content:
Hi beautiful people ‚ù§Ô∏è Just wanted to vent here over the same feelings everyone else probably has. 

I‚Äôve been watching a lot of shows (haven‚Äôt we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I‚Äôve become so used to how we‚Äôre living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I‚Äôve been feeling. I hate that I‚Äôm afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we‚Äôre in a long distance relationship when he‚Äôs only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can‚Äôt hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai‚Äôi (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it‚Äôs so emotionally draining. And it doesn‚Äôt help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don‚Äôt follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it‚Äôs like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn‚Äôt do the same so I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs all for nothing. We‚Äôve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I‚Äôm just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can‚Äôt. And I know I can‚Äôt. I just wish I could. 

I just needed to vent because like everyone else, I just feel so drained. But I still feel lucky to have what and who I have at the same time. I just wish this was over already. It feels like it won‚Äôt ever be.

Post 423: You aren‚Äôt dying.
Content:
You aren‚Äôt dying. You don‚Äôt have a rare disease or cancer. No tumors or some weird flesh eating virus that hasn‚Äôt been seen in decades. You aren‚Äôt going insane. You don‚Äôt have MS, or any other genetic disorder. You have anxiety. May I suggest a list of good vibes for this spooky season?? 

1) love yourself. Actually mean it though. Look in the mirror and instead of analyzing your body over anything that appears to be different tell yourself how amazing you are. 

2) drink water, I mean lots of water, drink some liquid IV also. Comes in many flavors and it‚Äôs a lot healthier than other drinks. Try to lay off the sodas (however treat yourself every now and then)

3) sleep. I mean sleep like you never slept before. Go to bed earlier, turn your phone on airplane mode and just let the cold room engulf you as if you are in the Arctic (that‚Äôs how cold I love it) 

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile) 

5) breathing exercises. This is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. Did you know breathing can help with a lot of medical problems? I suggest you read a book called ‚ÄúBreath‚Äù by James Nestor. It‚Äôs an extraordinary piece of work.

Remember to love yourself and remember that I love you.

Post 424: A shoutout to people who doesn‚Äôt have any emotional support from family or friends
Content:
I don‚Äôt know what I want to say with this post really, and I hope someone doesn‚Äôt get offended by it.

I just want to share my thoughts and support to anyone in that situation. It isn‚Äôt much but I want to shed some lights on you. Some of us has this kind of support but it‚Äôs easy to take it for granted.

Keep fighting. I really hope you can get help and support from someone you are close to soon. Also, this sub has proven that a lot of redditors like to help strangers.

Post 425: It‚Äôs insane to me how different things are when you are severely depressed/anxious , vs. when you are not. It disguises itself as something important.
Content:
When you‚Äôre not so low mentally and for once you feel great, the things you worry yourself to death over all day every day when you are struggling, are the same things you are proud of when you are not struggling. When you feel whole again and not like every decision is life and death. 

The things some people don‚Äôt understand about the people who commit suicide/think about suicide, is that we do not want to die. We just want to escape the pain that we can‚Äôt seem to putting ourselves through. I promise there is hope. Please keep going, I‚Äôm speaking from experience of doing some things I don‚Äôt even want to type to myself, you will see that light again that you once saw in life. You will smell things, look at things, listen to things, become genuinely intrigued with what people say, or everyday hobbies. 

I promise this bullshit is not permanent. Just keep finding yourself and growing. You are still growing emotionally, spiritually, etc, even when you don‚Äôt think you are. And one day you will all of a sudden realize, ‚Äúholy shit, I‚Äôve came so far mentally from that pit I used to be in. ‚Äú

Trust yourself. Only you really knows you.

Post 426: Does anyone else dread a new day during the evening?
Content:
As soon as the evening starts getting later, I dread going to bed sometimes because I don't want another day full of responsibilities that are making me anxious to start... I just want the evening of relaxing to be endless. Does anyone else get this??

Post 427: people really underestimate just how dehabilitating anxiety is
Content:
a while ago, i saw a post about a guy who was afraid to go into costco, and was asking all of these questions that would come across as obvious. the comments were all vicious and mean, they were all mocking him. i couldn't help but feel bad, not only for the guy, but for myself as well, because i found what he posted very relatable. i'm who struggles to do things alone, it made me sad to know that people view me this way.


i thought, if he was suffering from something "serious" like depression, i'm sure the commenters would not post the things they did. but since it's "just" anxiety, it's fine to make fun of them. it's hard having severe anxiety and having people mocking you on top of it. just makes me sad.

Post 428: Send me good vibes if you can‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting married today

If you could please send me any good vibes or pray to anyone you believe in that I can make it through today, I would really appreciate it. I‚Äôm getting married today and my anxiety is on hyperdrive. üñ§

Post 429: I got on stage in front of 600 people to deliver a speech for a public speaking competition... And I won!!!
Content:
## Some Context
I was diagnosed with ADHD in March, that same day I decided to conquer my fear and spoke on stage for the first time in a public speaking competition against 9 other people. I ended up winning! 

A few nights ago, I competed in the Finals for title of *Inspirational Speaker of the Year* and many other amazing prizes... 

And I won!

Post 430: Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety?
Content:
For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks. She accepted shows playing 24/7 but she didn't get it like y'all do :)

Post 431: UPDATE TO: This past weekend, I overcame my anxiety and decided to shoot my shot: I asked out a guy I have a huge crush on and he said yes!! We're going out to get coffee soon üòäüòä
Content:
Unfortunately, getting coffee isn't going to happen as he is currently talking to another girl and said she wouldn't be too happy with him getting coffee with another girl \*sigh\* **üòí** **üòí** 

I'm glad he told me even though I'm disappointed and I very much respect him, so hopefully we can be friends or something (because I really really like him and think he's super cool) so yeah... that's a thing... 

Post 432: Does anyone else just hide when people are outside of their house?
Content:
  Just like the teenager memes about hiding in your room when company is over, I'm in the adult version of this situation. I'm one of those teenagers who is now grown with a home of my own. There's a guy working on my roof and I've been in hiding all morning. 

  I can't let my dogs outside yet or they will bark and draw attention to me. I can't go too close to the windows or he will see me. I can't watch TV or play music or he will know I'm here. I have to tiptoe around my house so it seems like no one is home. 
  
  I'm home alone, hiding where there are no windows and too scared to come out. I feel like a rat scurrying around the shadows trying to avoid being seen. It feels dumb, but the thought he might see me is terrifying. I'm not the only one, right?

Post 433: The people on this sub are genuinely some of the most understanding by people I‚Äôve interacted with on Reddit
Content:
This post is by no means meant to detract from other support subreddits, but I genuinely feel like the people on here are so understanding. I think having to struggle with something internal like anxiety every day gives someone a more empathetic perspective on other people‚Äôs situations. Rather than advising OPs to overcome their external circumstances, people on here give them the support to manage their internal struggles because change isn‚Äôt possible without addressing that. Thank you so much to everyone on here for making 2020 feel less alone and difficult. I know what you are dealing with is awful, but I also know that you are incredible for keeping on. Wishing you a better, if not the best, year ahead.

Post 435: has anyone else‚Äôs anxiety worsened so much during quarantine?
Content:
i had ocd, health anxiety, panic disorder, and gad. everything was under control and then during quarantine being stuck inside made me go fucking insane. i think of quarantine as like a metaphor for being stuck inside just like we‚Äôre stuck inside our heads and have trouble with the external world. this has been absolute hell. my heart is always racing i think i have a heart disease.

Post 436: In just over a month my anxiety is down from 11/10 to 1/10.
Content:
Cutting out all caffeine took me to a 8/10, still panicking and always on edge. 

50 mg Zoloft took away my panic attacks and brought me to around a 5/10 (I still wasn‚Äôt happy but it literally changed my life, I didn‚Äôt spiral anymore) ACCEPTANCE/ and CLAIRE WEEKES METHOD WAS USED TO FIGHT BACK NOW THAT I COULD BECAUSE OF THE ZOLOFT.


Focusing on eating healthy Whole Foods, sleeping, and exercising has all but finished my anxiety.

I almost can‚Äôt be triggered anymore and I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack since I started Zoloft. Used to be unable to eat and sleep I was so anxious.

Post 437: I can‚Äôt sleep because I have anxiety and I have anxiety because I can‚Äôt sleep.

Content:
So a friend told me this and I think it's really helpful.

If you ever catch yourself rethinking something humiliating you did, stop and instead try to remember something embarrassing someone else did.
You probably can't and that's probably the case for everyone else and nobody remembers what you did.

And always remember, fuck anxiety, it‚Äôs all energy! Embrace it!


Edit: first silver ever!  Thanks kind stranger. 

I suffer from anxiety all the time. As I‚Äôve gotten older I try to focus on the anxiety as energy moving throughout my body.  If I have anxiety and I feel it in my stomach, I zone in on how my stomach is feeling, pay attention to the anxiety moving throughout my body and it helps to relieve it eventually, don‚Äôt ignore it as it‚Äôs there for your attention, something about your mental thinking or the physical world is causing this energy to enter your body, find out what it is, pay attention, don‚Äôt ignore it.

Post 441: Hadn‚Äôt Left the house in four years update.
Content:
Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn‚Äôt able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn‚Äôt see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best.

Post 442: Does anyone else find themselves rehearsing what they are going to say?
Content:
Just a few minutes ago, I started looking in the mirror and practiced a joke that I could say later tonight with my friends. I tried it dozens of ways for about ten minutes before I realized what I was doing. I just told myself I was weird and should stop worrying, even though that never works. Please tell me I'm not the only one?

Edit: It‚Äôs the day after I posted this. I just realized I‚Äôm an absolute moron. I forgot to tell the joke.

Post 445: Feels like I am constantly bracing for the next "bad thing" to happen to me.
Content:
Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

EDIT: Wow, I really had no idea this post would take off the way it did. It's funny that I used my throwaway account, for discussing some of the issues that I'm most embarrassed about, and am getting some of the best responses and best advice on. Thank you to each and every one of you.

Post 448: Does anyone get the anxiety poops?
Content:
Totally gross and TMI, but I‚Äôve noticed since my anxiety has been through the roof, I‚Äôve been having the runs and it just reminds me how bad my anxiety can actually get. I feel like that 7 year old in third grade absolutely scared about everything one day. It‚Äôs literally like a switch flipped in my brain and I knew something was wrong with me mentally. 

Now, I‚Äôm 27 and feel like I‚Äôm experiencing it all over again. It literally got triggered by something small and kind of a big change. It‚Äôs a good change and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been wanting so bad and in the back of my head it keeps telling me I‚Äôve failed and that it‚Äôs going to backfire. I know that‚Äôs not true at all. I‚Äôm having to play the waiting game on something and it‚Äôs driving me absolutely bonkers.

 So, I‚Äôve been so anxious and stressed that I‚Äôm literally having to run to the toilet. And not only that, I‚Äôve been so anxious to the point I feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up. It fucking sucks. Ugh. Does anyone else have this issue with their stomach? üòÖ

Hi,

This is me. Worrying about my assignments just makes me stay still and not do anything.

Not doing anything leads to even more anxiety and more anxiety cripples me from doing anything. Its like a shitty negative feedback loop. 


As a result Im actually failing this unit lol. Every assignment has been handed late due to cripplying anxiety. 

I even got a fucking extension and I am way past THAT due date as well.

I‚Äôm having an absolutely awful anxiety day - I‚Äôm guessing the fact that it‚Äôs tonight is primarily causing it, and I don‚Äôt want to go at all.

Post 463: Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?
Content:
To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn‚Äôt already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn‚Äôt pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I‚Äôve been doing great! I‚Äôll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I‚Äôve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I‚Äôm not doing enough. I‚Äôve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it‚Äôs always been a hobby.)  But I‚Äôm feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can‚Äôt find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I‚Äôm surviving and doing things that make me happy?

Post 464: social media is toxic as fuck
Content:
I hate social media... It is a well known fact that it has a lot of negative effects on its users.   


This year, I have deleted all my social media accounts, and people closest to me treat me like a fucking mentally ill freak questioning why I am off social media like people you know I am depressed, and this shit doesn't fucking help!!! And like wtf do you really want me to take a video of my breakfast everyday like fuck off and let me live my life with or without you genuinely in it you noisy fucks. 

&#x200B;

People it's not healthy to invite everyone into your life, and post a fake summary of how your doing. The majority of users are not happy and they keep this egotistical game of LOOK AT ME going in this circle jerk of likes. WHO THE FUCK CARES!

get over yourself and leave me alone.

When I‚Äôm anxious and slowly feel myself starting to spiral down into my anxious thoughts, I was always reaching out to other people, just needing to hear someone tell me I‚Äôm going to be okay. Now I have realised the only person I need to hear those words from are myself. I am slowly learning that a lot of the time it really is mind over matter; and oh boy, is my mind strong. I don‚Äôt need to depend on other people to reassure me I am okay. I can‚Äôt. I need to break the cycle. 
I feel I have come so far. I can sit there and tell myself I am going to be okay, and I can sort of believe it. It is so fucking hard to do, and it is so exhausting. I know each time I can do this I am making myself stronger. 

I don‚Äôt know why I am posting this. I guess I just had a sudden outburst of feeling somewhat empowered.

Every single day.

You might not know me, and I might not know you... we‚Äôre literally strangers! *I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU PEOPLE ARE!*

But to step up to the subreddit, post online about your personal problems, is brave as duck. 

 Please give yourself credit. Do you know what you did by simply posting that post about (x) ?? Someone might relate to it, and need help on (x) , someone might just be interested in (x) and read about it, someone might be going exactly what you‚Äôre going through, but remain silent... maybe they‚Äôll speak up because of you!!

With one push of a ‚ÄúPOST‚Äù , amazing things are sure to come with it... you spoke up about it... and that is SO GOOD! 

You‚Äôre more amazing than you know. You matter to me, if that means anything. 

Take care.

Please stay safe.

If anyone needs me, I‚Äôm always just a message away!! I don‚Äôt mind listening :) love to hear from new people!!

Keep your heads held high, hope you all have an amazing day / night... wherever you may live! 

Love you all! 

‚Äî I apologize if this isn‚Äôt allowed on the sub for some reason! It is my first post here :)

I‚Äôm sorry I ended up falling asleep! It was 3 am or so when I wrote this, and I thought ‚Äúonly a couple of people will see it‚Äù ... boy, was I wrong. 

Thanks for the awards, someone mentioned that someone wrote something similar, but its hard to find that post.. ‚Äî something like that - so I‚Äôll try my best to contribute a lot more here; probably a weekly thing! Like a weekly check up , see how everyone is, and such :) 

I‚Äôm just about to read the comments now, and reply!

#Edit V2

We all have that thought of ‚Äúthis looks so dumb‚Äù , ‚Äúwhy am I doing this?‚Äù when about to post online on a subreddit, and in social media in general... 

Know all those TikTok ‚Äúfamous people‚Äù ?? They are human, too. They probably were sure as ducky duck scared to post online for others to view , judge , comment , like , etc.,, but now look? They are perfectly okay with posting whatever ‚Äî even sometimes the silliest, stupidest things... those who comment ‚ÄúI wish I had the ability to do what you do‚Äù ... *You can* 

Nothing is stopping you. You are only stopping yourself! 

With one little push of a ‚Äúpost‚Äù could change your life.. change someones life, emotions, thinking process.. think its scary , right?! It is!!

Yes , anxiety...other mental illnesses... but THOSE DO NOT DEFINE YOU. You are more than your mental illness. Don‚Äôt be afraid to do what you love, and keep doin it! 

I am with you every step of the day. 

Together, we will both live our ‚Äúdream life‚Äù ... take care, sendin prayers that you have a good life!

Post 476: Corona killed my anxiety
Content:
Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.  

Not having to wake up early means I get 8 plus hours of sleep every night. I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  

Not having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). 

With all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement. 

It just feels like the wonderful break ive always dreamt of but never thought possible.  

Appreciate that this is a hard time for most and dont deny what people are going through.  I got lucky because I have a very stable job and its just my husband and I at home.

My job makes me pretty depressed.

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

Anyone else ever done something similar?

Not that I haven't had moments, but it's the longest I've been semi-stable. Being unalive hasn't crossed my mind in what I think is about two weeks, which I think is what I'm the most proud of.

Post 482: Anyone gets anxiety because of their anxiety?
Content:
I feel like I get anxiety or panic attack because I'm scared of those feelings. It's like I don't want to feel them and that's what triggers more anxiety. I don't know if this is a common feeling for those with anxiety disorder but I think it's exactly how I feel.

I'm almost 30 years old and I still lay awake at night, feeling like a complete idiot of myself when I was 10-16 years old. Then I realize how stupid it is to even care, but it doesn't really help.

How do you get past this stuff?

Post 484: I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever.
Content:
I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes ‚Äî whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology ‚Äî it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion ‚Äî something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: "Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks."

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer ‚Äî often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom ‚Äî it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, "You're doing great!"), and it automatically calls the next representative.

-----

At the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.

Long story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.

P.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.

**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good.

After an initial wave of catastrophizing, now I'm pumped up, haha!

A producer actually reached out to the little Facebook page my cohost and I run, and I didn't even think it was real at first. Woohoo!

EDIT: I am FLOORED by the support. I honestly didn't know until this moment what a difference the kind words of someone I've never met in person could make. I'm sitting at my computer, and I legitimately feel so cared about. It's incredible. Thank you! Those two words don't seem like enough, but thank you!

EDIT 2: They changed it to this morning last minute, and I barely slept this morning, but I NAILED IT. If I get a link to the interview, I'll add it here!  


EDIT 3: If anyone wants to give it a listen, I decided to be nice and proud about this and put it on little portfolio site. No pressure at all, [but you can find it here](https://www.christopherjdmitchell.com/blog/cbc-fresh-air-im-anxious-about). 

Post 487: I think the most disheartening thing about having anxiety is that it never goes away, you just learn how to cope better with it.
Content:
I cant see myself not having anxiety and really my heart just sinks. It‚Äôs just beyond cruel that this will be me for the rest of my life and the only thing that changes is how i manage it. There is no cure. I‚Äôm always going to be in my head one way or another. It‚Äôs exhausting.

Post 488: I'M GETTING THE HELP I NEED BECAUSE OF THIS SUB
Content:
recently looking at some of the posts on this sub has made me  think i may have anxiety, so because of this i arranged an appointment with my doctor, i was worried to go as i thought maybe what i'm feeling is normal. i was scared the doctor would judge me if it turned out my feelings where completely normal. however, after some more appointments my doctor has referred me to a specialist who will aim to diagnose me. it's still an ongoing process but i'd like to thank this sub for inspiring me to get help.

Content:
That is all

Post 491: Does anyone else here always feel like they‚Äôre in some sort of trouble or someone is upset with them?
Content:
I think one of the worse symptoms of my anxiety is that I often feel in ‚Äútrouble‚Äù or like someone is upset with me. 

Usually this will happen after working a shift or leaving classes for the day. 

I end up questioning the things I did or said during the day and if I did everything correctly. Often times these anxieties come up when trying to go to sleep. 

Does anyone else get this? How do you combat the feelings?

Post 492: Does anyone else feel overly stressed/anxious when the area/room they are in is cluttered and messy?
Content:
We are renovating our house right now and there are things everywhere and not where they normally belong, it is making me feel SO stressed and anxious. I literally feel heightened with the need to clean and put things back. The mess is at the forefront of my brain and it's like I am not able to function until everything is tidy and neat. I feel overwhelmed by it all.

Post 493: tattoo subreddit gave me massive anxiety
Content:
I got a tattoo on my inner forearm from one of my favorite manga. You can see it here: https://imgur.com/a/VFWrQ1Z . I got it facing towards me on purpose for a few reasons: I want to look at it and after placing the stencil facing away from me multiple times, I personally thought it would look best facing towards me. Long story short, I liked my ink and decided to share it in the tattoo subreddit. I didn't expect to get so much negative backlash about it facing the wrong way. I didn't mind the comments that had actual criticism on the ink itself, but there were just so many comments just shitting on me and enjoyment over it. I let their words get to me to the point where I let them dictate whether or not if I should enjoy my tattoo, because I do enjoy it. But because it's breaking a tattoo "rule" I feel like I'm not allowed to be happy about it. Now when i look at it, i feel like its wrong and looks stupid. Feel like i should be embarrassed about it. I just hate feeling dumb for enjoying my tattoo. All of this sounds super dumb but I just needed to let this out because it's been in my head all day.

edit: wow, i honestly didnt expect this post to blow up. i appreciate everyone's kind words. and for those who have gave me honest criticism explaining why the "rule" is there to begin with or any criticism with the tattoo itself, i appreciate it as well. like i stated before, i dont mind helpful feedback, just dont go attacking someone over it lol.

Post 494: I've had severe anxiety my ENTIRE LIFE. I think Magnesium has completely turned it around in a matter of like two days.
Content:
I recently had an issue with balance regarding a Thiamine deficiency, and I decided to start taking vitamins. It turns out- Magnesium makes me chill as a cucumber. I feel confident. I am not overthinking. I am also not High from taking this supplement. I just feel like....what I imagine someone with low anxiety feels like. Im not really saying other people should do it- im just saying as someone who has had Horrific anxiety my whole life, this is So refreshing.

I feel sick to my stomach but nothing works to get rid of it. I also feel out of breath and shaky. I just want it to go away.

Post 496: Anyone else not sold on partially re-opening states?
Content:
It doesn‚Äôt seem like anything is actually getting better. 

More like people just feel tired of being locked in. 

Partially re-opening doesn‚Äôt mean people are automatically safe again. 

It‚Äôs not like the problem is going to disappear after Apr. 30.

Bear in mind, you do still have to wait for your food and go take it from an employee, but it beats having to order it up front.

Post 500: Spending lunch in the bathroom my first day of work just like my first day of high school
Content:
My trainer abandoned me to wander around the facility trying to find the lunch room on my own and all my coworkers didn‚Äôt bother to acknowledge me or say hi. Got so anxious I went to the bathroom and started dry heaving and decided I might as well just stay in here. Cried a lot. Trying to hold the tears back going back to work now. Stressed I‚Äôm going to cry in front of my trainer after being totally normal the first half of shift. I‚Äôm honestly so exhausted from just trying to exist as a human being.

Post 502: Anyone else find themselves trying to anticipate EVERYTHING instead of just living?
Content:
Title says it mostly. I‚Äôm just curious if anyone else has the same tendency? I just can‚Äôt stop trying to anticipate everyone‚Äôs reaction to something or everything‚Äôs.


Edit: well shit this got a lot more attention than I.... anticipated. Going to read comments now an hopefully reply to some.

Post 503: I slept with the lights off for the first time in 15+ years
Content:
I‚Äôve had crippling nighttime anxiety around someone hiding in my apartment and watching me. It has severely impacted my sleep and I‚Äôve had to sleep with all the lights on, locks on all of my doors, just every coping mechanism possible since I was 8 or 9. For the past 2 years I‚Äôve been in therapy and doing small exposures to disprove this belief that I have. 

Last night was the first time I could turn off all the lights in my bedroom and sleep in the dark. 

Seems small but I‚Äôm proud

Post 504: DAE get nervous to return to work or school after you've been away for a little while?
Content:
For me, it doesn't seem to matter how comfortable I am somewhere (though it is worse at newer/less familiar places), but if I get sick or something and skip a few days of class or work, I get really anxious to go back. Particularly when I've been sick because I'm afraid I won't be totally better and I'll have to come home or it'll cause a lot of problems. Right now, I'm returning to work after leaving sick last week and I'm really anxious about it.

Post 505: I went on the highway by myself for the first time!
Content:
It‚Äôs a small accomplishment but I feel so proud of myself for getting over my fears!

Post 506: Anyone else feel so self-aware of their anxiety, it almost feels like you‚Äôre faking it?
Content:
Even in the middle of a mild panic attack, I can feel myself freaking out ‚Äî I know my breathing is shallow, my heart is beating really fast, and my thoughts are scrambled and erratic. But because I‚Äôm aware of all of this, it almost makes me feel bad, like I‚Äôm putting on some kind of performance, or am just reacting this way for attention (even when I‚Äôm by myself!)

Maybe it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense when I type it out, but does anyone else feel this way?

Post 507: Does anyone get the feeling that you're supposed to be worrying about something but you just can't figure out what it is?
Content:
Like, right now I feel like there's something I should be worrying about and it's killing me, it's driving me nuts, and it's keeping me on edge because I don't know what it is and I honestly just want to flip every table I see.

This happens like ALL THE TIME and sometimes I hope my brain is just normal.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all so much for the replies! It made me realize that I'm not alone and that there are other people who experience the same thing I'm experiencing right now and it made my day, thank you!

I hope you all have a good day!

(Hopefully me editing this post won't make offend anyone and I'm sorry if someone happens to get offended by it. I just wanted to express my gratitude)

Post 508: Does anyone else find themselves having anxiety about having to get up early in the morning?
Content:
I'm 27. I've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time.

Post 509: I (30f) just celebrated my 1 year anniversary with the only bf who's ever taken my anxiety seriously.
Content:
We both make allowances for each other's mental health and support each other every single day. 

I could've settled for someone who didn't understand or support me, but I had the confidence to leave those relationships and wait for the perfect partner. 

I'm really glad about that. It was tempting just to have someone next to me. Waiting for real love is worth it, even when you feel like you'll never meet your soul mate. We met on tinder of all places! After years of feeling alone in the world, I finally feel part of a team. Don't give up!

Post 510: Have you ever felt so depressed that you feel actually sick?
Content:
This weekend has been horrible for me, i had maybe 3-4 panic attacks just on the weekend, would maybe be more if I didn't take a computer session, but here is the thing I don't have fever, but now is Monday and i haven't had a panic attack yet but I feel like I need to puke and I'm so hot that I'm sweating, I didn't go to work because I felt like shit.

Post 511: The list I keep on my phone to help me calm down during high stress and anxiety
Content:
Not sure it will help anyone else but here is a list of stuff I keep on my phone to help me calm down during moments of high stress and anxiety.  I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù, the better I feel.
* It‚Äôs just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What‚Äôs the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don‚Äôt focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don‚Äôt have to do anything.
* It‚Äôs not what I have to do. It‚Äôs what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
* Don‚Äôt be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn‚Äôt be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don‚Äôt have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there‚Äôs nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept¬†the anxiety. Don‚Äôt try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch¬†the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act¬†normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don‚Äôt try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat¬†the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You‚Äôll see that you‚Äôll calm down soon.
* Expect¬†the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don‚Äôt focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

&#x200B;

**Other**

* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow! This post really blew up from when I posted it during an anxiety attack. I'm glad that so many people find it useful and hope you guys gain as much mileage from this list as I have. :D

Post 512: I ASKED FOR A DAY OFF!!!!
Content:
I'm so excited rn omggggg. The schedule for next week came out today and I was super excited because I had two days off in a row and my mental health hasn't been the greatest lately so I was super excited. But then my mom spoke for me (she works at the same place I do) and said I wanted another day for more hours so I was scheduled another day and only had one day off. I was so upset so I went to talk to the person that makes the schedules and I was honest with her. I said that my mental health hasn't been great and that I would like to have the two days in a row. She was so nice about it and just gave the shift to someone else and I'm so proud of myself!

Tldr: overcame anxiety and was honest with my boss about my mental health

Post 513: I‚Äôm not doing well.
Content:
I just need to get things off my chest.

The truth is, I‚Äôm not doing well. I‚Äôm so overwhelmed these days, and I can‚Äôt relax. Something is always on my mind, something is always bothering me. I‚Äôm constantly irritated, and it‚Äôs frustrating. My emotions feel invalid ‚Äî I have a home, I have food on my table, what do I have to be upset or stressed over? I feel so disconnected from myself and from others. I‚Äôm afraid to reach out to others ‚Äî I‚Äôve definitely pushed a lot of people away this year. I don‚Äôt know how or if I can bounce back to whatever my *normal* was.

Edit: WOW, I did not expect to get this much feedback, but I thank each and every one of you for the advice and kind words.

Post 514: I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction
Content:
Posted it on r/relationship but got removed. The mods told me to post here instead.




English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few "hmm"s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as "crazy". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ‚ù§Ô∏è

&nbsp;


**Edit** : Thank you so much to everyone for taking the time to write a beautiful comment! I am really blessed and I'll never forget that! I hope  my story encourages you to reach out to people. You're not alone. Again, thank you so much :)

Today i learned my anxiety attacks are just like everyone else's , it's really comforting especially when the symptoms makes you feel like you're having a stroke but the neurologist was like :
 "don't worry you're fine"
I didnt believe him at first but now I do !

Post 517: I got ice cream on my own!
Content:
A few days ago, I really felt like getting some ice cream and I saw an ice cream shop down the road. Walking towards it, I was arguing with myself to do or not to do it. Would it be weird? Getting ice cream on my own? Who does that? I almost walked by, but something inside myself told me 'who cares, even if they think it's weird, you don't know these people and probably will never see them again'. I turned of my thoughts, got in line... And got some ice cream! It was great.

Post 518: I finally stood up to my housemate.
Content:
I've been in a pretty rotten housing situation for a year or so now. 
My two housemates (a couple) fight and scream alot, and generally are disrespectful of the fact that they share the space with other people (ie my boyfriend and I).
After being woke up to the sound of screaming again this morning, I finally stood up to my housemate and told her that she woke me up and that I was upset. She's famously combative so she tried to argue with me but for once, adrenaline kicked into my system in a useful way and I didn't back down. 
Ive been really anxious lately and struggling personally so I'm really proud that I managed to speak my mind. 

Thanks for reading if you did.

I always get a very bad stomachache (diarrhea, constant farting and all kinds of smelly stuff) especially when i get anxious - and it‚Äôs always my left side of my stomach. Ugh..it‚Äôs truly awful..anyone had the same experience or is currently going through it?

*updated post*
Hello again everyone - thank you so much for sharing your experience! definitely did not expect to receive a lot of comments. My only big difference with you is that I‚Äôve never been nauseous but just pumping out a lot of gases haha. Anyway, thanks again for your comments. I‚Äôm glad I am not alone in this:)

Post 522: my coworker recognized that I have anxiety
Content:
I just started a job working at Dairy Queen as a cashier (this is my third day). I don‚Äôt make the food, I take orders and money, bring/give food to people, and clean up the store/restock when needed. today, I messed up an order. me and four of my coworkers were standing in a circle trying to figure out the confusion, when I, using my classic dry humor to cope, said ‚ÄúOh my God I‚Äôm going to have a panic attack now‚Äù. One of my coworkers said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, breathe in, breathe out‚Äù. Later, she came up to me and asked if I had anxiety. I said yes, I‚Äôve had it since I was 7. She said to let me know if anything was ever overwhelming me, and she would help me out. it‚Äôs honestly one of the sweetest things anyone has ever said to me.

Content:
Literally haven't had a problem with ibs symptoms for way over a week now, I finally thought maybe my body is healing and getting back to normal, and then I get hit with the worst stomach cramps on and off all day, my stomach is just in pieces at the moment and it's getting me so down. It's like doing hurdles. Every time I jump one successfully, I end up tripping over the next 7.

Post 525: I TOOK A SHOWER!!

Post 526: DAE: Hate when people tell you ‚Äùget out of your comfort zone‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not growing if you‚Äôre in your comfort zone‚Äù
Content:
I hate it because I‚Äôm ALWAYS uncomfortable. That‚Äôs just how generalized anxiety it; you‚Äôre always anxious because everything makes you anxious.
I understand the concept of this saying/phrase, but for me/people who are never comfortable, it disregards how we feel on a day to day basis: anxious. Uncomfortable. Never able to chill out or calm down because we are driven by anxiety. 
.

That‚Äôs all I wanted to say.

Post 527: I'm genuinely tired from overthinking and worrying about useless stuff.
Content:
Someone hit me, so I could cry instead and divert my focus. Or take my heart out,so I won't feel the heart palpitations as I get anxious and stressed. It's frustrating and simply tires me out. Like, I can barely breathe. I'm so tired of this cycle of worrying and overthinking. 

Fuck this shit, I want to only focus on good things even though I don't have any, I'll make some, I guess.

Edit; I really thank you for your comments and helpful advices. It means alot.. Also, to the people in same situation as me, hang on, friend! We're all in this together.

Post 528: We don't deserve this.
Content:
None of us do, what we deal with daily is a living hell, and we just don't deserve it at all. It's hard living like this, unbearably hard but let's not forget that we're so strong and resilient for fighting it daily. Some people might wave us off and disregard how we feel with comments like "just relax, it's not even that bad, you're just overreacting." but that's bullshit. I know how it is, we all do, and I want you all to know I'm proud of you, you woke up today and you faced anxiety head on, you did a thing, be it small or big you tackled today's tasks and you didn't crumble under anxiety. You're improving, you're doing better bit by bit, and I know how hard that is. So if no one else will tell you, I will, I'm proud of you and you're doing damn good. It might take a long time but I know each and every one of us can overcome this, it might take longer for some of us, but we'll do it. So just keep tackling it day by day, we're stronger than this, we never asked for this, we never once did anything to deserve this, but I know we'll beat it. Stay strong, I love all of you.

Post 532: Does anyone else feel like they overthink literally everything?
Content:
Any time I make a friend I am always filled with this innate concern that they secretly hate me. Even when I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong, if the person is reading texts and not responding I get stressed that I did something. I know that they don‚Äôt actually need to respond and it shouldn‚Äôt bother me, but why can I never seem to think that people might actually just like me for me?

Post 533: Anyone else get paranoid that everyone hates them?
Content:
I have social anxiety and sometimes I get an overwhelming feeling that everyone around me hates me. I walk through work and I feel like everyone is staring and I did something wrong but I don't know what. I start to panic and I just want to quit and go hide. Anybody else ever feel this way?

Edit: thank you to everyone who commented. It‚Äôs nice to feel like you‚Äôre not alone in this world. I‚Äôve often heard a dismissive ‚Äúthat‚Äôs irrational. Stop it‚Äù  when discussing this feeling and it‚Äôs so refreshing to see others relating and giving great advice. Thanks again everyone :) have a great day!

Post 534: My son isn't even two yet, but sat beside me through an anxiety attack.
Content:
So I was having an anxiety attack  in my kitchen. My son was watching TV in the next room and I could hear him. So I sat on the floor and started with the breathing. A few minutes later, he comes into the kitchen cocks his head to the side. He comes over kisses me on the forehead. Then he sits besides me on the floor with a toy and smiles at me then plays with his toy until I calm down. 

Must have done something right with this kid.

Post 535: Does anybody get upset if they are going to be late?
Content:
Even if it is a few minutes late... you get really upset. And if you're going to be very late to the event/meeting, you try to find an excuse to not show up at all.

I remember there was a day where I was late to everything. I remember feeling incredibly exhausted and frustrated with myself at the end of the day even if it was out of my control.

For me, being on time means that I am sticking to my routine and that things are going as planned. When I am late, I feel like a mess.

What can you do to make being late ok? I know it's not a big deal to those around me if I am a few mins late, but I feel horrible about myself.

Post 538: Does anyone else's anxiety give you physical symptoms even hours after you actually got anxious?
Content:
So it's almost 5:30 and I can't sleep because my heart is racing. I had some bad anxiety a few hours ago, and I was also dumb enough to consume caffeine today.


Edit: Wow, I didn't expect so many people to relate! I'll try to read/reply to as many comments as I can when time permits. And thank you soooo much for the silver, helpful, and wholesome awards!! :)

Post 539: UPDATE: OH MY GOD YOU GUYS I GOT MY FIRST JOB!!
Content:
I was already proud enough of [getting through just the interview ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/bkn5eo/update_im_at_my_job_interview/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

but oh my god, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd actually get the job!! I know I‚Äôm super late to this getting-your-first-job thing but hey, better late than never, right!? 

I‚Äôm just going to be bagging groceries but I‚Äôll be making $3 an hour more than I ever thought I‚Äôd make and oh my god.. I HAVE A JOB HOLY SHIT 

I have a week to mentally prepare myself for training. Everyone so far has been so extremely kind, so I feel a lot better about the whole thing though I‚Äôm still shaking with nerves right now. The manager is extremely kind, the woman I just talked to on the phone was amazing, I met some of the people I‚Äôll be working with and they were all so very nice. 

Is it stupid I actually want to cry??? I‚Äôm so happy??

Post 540: When I'm anxious, I procrastinate. After I procrastinate, I ruminate. Since I'm ruminating, I'm anxious to even get anything done, that I should have long started, thinking, "What's the point of doing it now, remember the first time you tried and failed by procrastinating ..."
Content:
And I wonder why I am losing control over my life.

update: A silver and these comments down below - whoa! I was sleeping on this post, much like how that initial novelty wears off from anything on Reddit. But I did sign-up for gym in the meanwhile, after 8 odd years of reluctance. As u/Basith_Shinrah pointed out in a comment down below,‚Äú*You put it in words. I feel that's the first step in overcoming it*‚Äù.

Post 541: Does anyone else feel an insane amount of anxiety in the morning?
Content:
I wake up, and it slaps me straight in my eyeball, from my head to my toes I feel anxiety. For the first 30 minutes or so is just absolute anxiety, I don‚Äôt want to get up, I don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone, I just want to lay down and try to sleep to avoid that feeling (obviously I can‚Äôt)

Post 542: Here's to all of us at work who have snapped at colleagues, cried quietly at desks (or bathroom), had panic attacks and ruminated about it for hours on end!

We are doing the best we can. It's not easy, struggling and working at the same time. We are not failures. Don't give up!

Post 543: Does anyone else get anxiety around people there own age but are fine with older people?

At work im pretty confident and anxiety free but when I'm walking through town my anxiety is high.

Has anyone found a solution as to what causes this?

Post 544: "A man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears"

After reading this quote many times it made me rethink my anxiety and take a new perspective. Hopefully the insight will inspire you as well.

Post 545: Does anyone else get really anxious and scared when they have to go back to college/school after a long break?
Content:
Also tbf one of my teachers does bully me and so do many of the students but the thought of going back to college tomorrow is really stressing me out and making me really scared. I know that once tomorrow comes it'll likely calm my nerves a bit but still nothing sets my anxiety off more than going back to college

Post 546: Call me crazy but I'm loving the lockdown and curfew thingy.
Content:
It's really crazy but I'm lovin' it. I'm particularly not anxious about corona since my city barely had one case and barely 10 or lower cases in my state. It's all been taken care of, so. But still, with lockdown and curfew as precaution, I kinda like it. I went up to the roof of my apartment and noticed how quiet the world seems to me. It was kind of comforting. I felt at peace. There were no noise from construction beside me and the one in front of me. There were no noises from vehicles or people. The only sound were of my footsteps and the birds. Sigh, all the anxiety I had at home, vanished in mere second.

Post 547: Sunday night. Not wanting to go to bed, because boom, it‚Äôs Monday morning. Absolute worst. We‚Äôre doing it together though. All of us. You‚Äôre not alone.
Content:
We‚Äôre all feeling the Sunday scarries. I despise Sunday specifically for this. 

Let‚Äôs start the week right though. Positive energy rather than negative. Smiles rather than frowns, etc. and any other cliches you can think of. 

Let‚Äôs do it together, let‚Äôs make the best of this. Better days and a better life are coming. You are not alone

I feel like when my anxiety is super bad I will sit for HOURS just mindlessly scrolling through my phone it‚Äôs so bad. I could sit all day and do it.

Post 550: Hey you. Yes, you.

You‚Äôre going to be okay. Take a deep breath. Everything is going to be alright! 


Post 551: Looking back on highly anxious times is so embarrassing, the cringe makes me even more anxious
Content:
You know, those times you constantly needed reassurance and you knew people were getting tired of you for it. Yeah, those times. 

When I think of those times I just want to isolate myself and never talk to anyone ever again.

Post 552: Was suicidal with anxiety eight years ago...getting married on Saturday.
Content:
Eight years ago today I had had enough and sat on the sea wall at midnight about to throw myself in. Single, victim of DV, no full time job. I had terrible flashbacks, panic attacks, couldn't sleep. Now I'm still anxious but medication has helped enormously. I have a permanent full time job I love, a partner I love and I got to see my boys become fine young men. See your doctor. You can get through this x

Post 553: I (41M) stood up for myself in a relationship for the first time in my life. It cost the relationship but I feel great about valuing my needs. Use meds if you can people. I wish I started sooner.
Content:
She told me kissing me wasn't worth it. She said she won't be able to give me a family I wanted so what's the point. She could have been discussing the weather. 

She then in the same breath asked me to help her with a presentation. 

She is a doctor. Makes 4 times more then I do. She is accustomed to getting her way. Saying things without consequences. 

Not this time. Not with me. 

 I stood up. Told her she needs to reevaluate her wants in life and I'm going to give her her space. 

I left. She messaged me. She wanted me to go on a trip with her. She said she was willing to pay.

 I asked her "what's the point?". 

Before meds I would have been at her beck and call. I would have been in shambles. I would have given her opportunities time and time again. 

I will miss her mother. I will miss her dogs. I won't miss being treated that way. I am saddened that I'm alone again. But I'm effin proud that I drew my line in the sand and refused to budge. 

If you have the opportunity to seek help, use meds etc please do so. The power and self worth that comes with less anxiety is amazing.

Edit: I am overwhelmed by the support I've seen in this post. Thank you all for your comments and PMs. The rewards were also lovely. 

Your comments have helped me more then you know. Thank you for your support!

Post 554: Does anyone wake up hours before alarm because you are anxious about something that next day?
Content:
Happened to me today!

Barely slept and still had 3 more hours to sleep but my body noped out of that and woke me up.

What am I supposed to do with those 3 hours???

Worry more???

Wtf body I hate anxiety.

Post 555: I hate how, since we were young, society has engraved on us that we should have our lives figured out on our 20s.
Content:
I've been living like a robot these past few days and I've been telling myself to numb everything so I wouldn't get hurt. How nice would it actually be to not think and feel at all huh. It doesn't help that the people around me see this robot as a 'strong' person who can stay composed at the face of adversity. I'm not strong and I wish I can just yell it out but that would cause more pain within the family that would only end with one affected party, which is, *surprise surprise,* me. I don't have my life figured out at 20 and my mind is very persistent in chasing this hourglass time limit of succeeding in life. I know and understand that we all have our paces and that nothing is ever easy in life but why won't this mind just stop thinking. Even as I'm writing this my heart is doing its thing and it just hurts.

Post 556: Tonight I finally asked the guy in the next apartment over to stop yelling to people over the computer to all hours of the night after about 3 months of trouble sleeping because of the noise.
Content:
I was shaking the whole time but I said what I meant to and this is a major win for me. Of course I‚Äôm going to ruminate on the situation now and have trouble sleeping for that reason tonight but hopefully tomorrow night will be better. And yeah, the yelling was really that bad.

Post 557: Just overheared my parents calling me dumb for not getting over my anxiety yet.
Content:
I went downstairs to drink water and I overheard my parents saying that I'm dumb for still having anxiety and it would be solved if I went outside more.
My parents seem to think that I am inexperienced and if I simply went outside more and stopped caring my anxiety would magically go away.

I'm sure the only reason I have anxiety in the first place is because of them.

They like to say all of my problems are "anxiety" and "being bored" and they think I was pretending to have depression because I'm able to laugh.

Post 558: If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...
Content:
 A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I‚Äôve struggled for years and... I‚Äôm still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone <3

EDIT #1: added one more step thanks to u/SaltedBiscuitTV
EDIT #2: thanks to u/veraamber for the reminder on "imagining you're elsewhere" might be harmful to some people
EDIT #3: as I am still in a very agitated mood and my legs are sore from all the stress I just realized... first silver thingy on here x2! It feels amazing that venting while I was having a hard time helped someone out - Thank you! :') 
EDIT #4: Close your eyes after you read all of it ;)

Post 559: What having Anxiety look like:
Content:
No motivation. 
Isolating yourself. 
Listening music to escape from reality. 
Craving unhealthy food.
Pushing people you love away.
Biting nails.
Your leg shaking uncontrollable. 
Spill mascara. 
Shortness of breath.
Overthinking. 
Negative thinking. 
Sleep problems.
Sleeping  to escape from reality. 
Crying.
Disassociation. 

Having anxiety is probably one of the most lonely,  most isolating things to have. Because you are your own worst enemy.  And you live inside your head.

A big hug to all of us ‚ô°

Post 560: DAE feel like their anxiety was taught/acquired through traumatic experiences and the "real you" is completely opposite from the person your anxiety makes you?
Content:
For example, I can be really really anxious and unsure in social situations, but sometimes when I can overcome it, I find myself very easily and very confidently talking to people. It feels like that person is the "real me" who just gets smothered by uncertainty and anxiety.

As in, I don't think my personality is anxious or shy or unsure, but I so rarely get to see that part of myself because I'm constantly bogged down with anxieties.

Post 561: Job hunting when you have an anxiety disorder...
Content:
I honestly feel like if there was one thing that could perfectly trigger my anxiety attacks and tick all of the boxes that trigger my panic attacks, it would be job hunting. And it has.

Questioning my overall self-worth? Check.

Questioning my few skills? Check.

Panicking at long job descriptions where the words blur together from said panic and nothing makes sense because my brain stops functioning as my heart palpitates and my hands shake? Check.

Feeling like an overall failure because I don‚Äôt qualify for/get rejected from a job? Check.

Becoming overstimulated and hyperventilating from the sheer amount of positions to scroll through? Check.

‚ÄúThey expect *all* 45 bulletpoints of this from me? I‚Äôm not capable, I‚Äôm just a jack of all trades, my brain would explode on a daily basis, I can‚Äôt do this.‚Äù Check. 

Re-doing my resume 35 times because it‚Äôs just never *perfect* enough? Check.

Not being able to decide what I want to do with my life and thus experiencing an overwhelming desire to just give up? Check.

Catastrophizing my situation, which then turns into full blown panic attacks on a weekly basis because I haven‚Äôt heard back from any jobs and thus being convinced I‚Äôll be unemployed forever? Check.

Job hunting is a soul-sucking experience for everyone involved. At the same time, I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs one of the most unbearable experiences for people who struggle with GAD. Or at least it seems to be for me.

Typing this after waking up today to find myself finally recovering from two straight days of panic attacks coupled with some fabulous depressive episodes thrown in. I was knocked completely out of commission after a week of overworking myself with the job hunt, and spent two days crying, shaking, taking Ativan when needed, and feeling like ‚Äúnothing will ever be okay again‚Äù.

*Sigh.*

Back at it.

**EDIT**: Wow. Came back to this post late in the day and didn‚Äôt realize how much it had been noticed. Thank you guys so much for the kind words, the advice, and the support- and for sharing your own relatable stories. I wish things were easier and I know we struggle like hell, but here‚Äôs to everyone who commented hopefully landing a job they love, despite all of this. Thanks again for all of the support and for making me feel *far* less alone in my thoughts/struggles. Even though a lot of the comments were you guys simply relating to what I wrote, that in and of itself was so helpful to hear (and I really wish nobody else had to feel this way...but there‚Äôs comfort in knowing I‚Äôm not alone). You‚Äôre all amazing humans. ‚ù§Ô∏è (and thanks for the the awards!)

Edit: thank you for all the positive feedback, it puts a smile on my face to know that you can believe in this post and that you're all filled with hope ;)

It's ofcourse often not easy to believe in yourself, a "quick fix" doesn't exist and maybe this post is very vague for you. I elaborated on this topic in the comments. Hope it can help you!

Post 563: Anyone else also have Social Anxiety to the point when you go out in public you think everyone is judging you because people keep looking at you

I get nervous and feel like I wanna cry because Im always thinking people are silently judging me

Post 564: Why does my body feel so anxious even if my mind is not.
Content:
I feel my skin is crawling and like I need to do something or I‚Äôm missing something. But the thing is my head isn‚Äôt anxious I‚Äôm not thinking of anything just trying to enjoy my day but my body is just ü•¥ I hate this feeling.

Post 565: Lady 1: how do you have depression, life is beautiful. Just think positive. Lady 2: how do you have asthama, there's so much free air.
Content:
I have a dream that one day everyone will take mental health seriously. 
'Just think positive, just breath, involve yourself in work, just do your hobbies, just listen good music, just don't think much, just pray, etc'
People who say all these, I'm sure they never know what a panic attack feels like.

Post 566: I'm angry at everyone who didn't notice I was struggling as a child
Content:
This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me. But today is definitely not that day.

Post 567: Does everyone else's anxiety feel more intense at night?
Content:
I swear that from the moment I wake up until dusk I feel good (to the point I don't feel anxious anymore) but when it's dark outside, even when I'm home with my family, my anxiety becomes more intense.

Post 568: i had to leave a movie theater last night.
Content:
Movie theaters have always freaked me out because they are, well, a target for shootings.

I still try to go. I have fun and it's a good way to get out of the house.

Last night I went to the premier of a movie. I was already feeling pretty bad because there was a line out the door, which we didn't expect because our town is so small and filled with old people and oilfield workers. But it was whatever, we got through and went into the theater.

Right as my heart began to try to settle, a man in the row next to me begins talking about his *gun.* that he *brought.* he made 2 remarks about it - the first one i tried to brush off because i thought i misheard him. the second one i did NOT mishear.

so my heart starts racing again and i'm shaking and starting to cry. i tried SO hard to keep it together because i was with my fiance and we were trying to have a date, yanno? but they were super understanding and did not mind at all that we had to go.

i know that i overreacted but i just really can't wrap my head around being comfortable in a confined space with a random stranger carrying a lethal weapon. especially at a premier night at a theater.

just wanted to vent i guess.

Post 569: The fact that this community exists makes me cry happy tears
Content:
It‚Äôs amazing! The fact that people from all over the world with the same problems come together to discuss and help each other is so beautiful. Sometimes I feel like everything is pointless and that I will never be normal again but then I just think about this community and it makes me happy. Thank you all.

Post 570: Do you ever say, "Okay, Let's start doing ____" and then just, literally wait for yourself to move?
Content:
It's just.. I dont know. I was so prepared to do something, and when I wanted to start, I literally just waited. Soon, I ended up getting anxious, lol. Like, I can't make an action for myself.

Edit: I'm so freakin glad to be able to relate to yall! I really thought it was only me.

Post 571: Have you ever felt anxious because everything in your life is going on perfectly, but you are worried about something wrong that might be happening without you realize it?
Content:
It's a period in my life when everything is fine. I didn't quarrel with my boyfriend in years, I am passing all my exams, my parents are strangely nice and comprehensive with me, I didn't even catch a cold and I am surrounded by lovely people... I am used to living an unpleasant life, bearing problems all the day and feeling nervous at night and deeply unhappy. However, now I COULD live the perfect life, but I keep asking myself why is everything fine, what's going to happen, if I have any disease, what terrifying destiny is going to punch me in the face. Because of this, my hypochondria is getting worse, I sometimes am convinced that it's not possible for me not to have problems in life, so I must have some deadly disease and every signal my body give to me makes me want to run to the doctor... Sometimes I can't sleep at night because I fear that my house will burn while I sleep, or that some thief will break into my home to steal something (even though we don't own anything valuable!) and doing bad to my family... Have you ever felt that way or am I just an idiot to feel even more anxious because I literally have NOTHING to worry about?

Post 573: Last night was the first night in years I didn‚Äôt have anxiety or have a panic attack
Content:
It felt so good not to feel anxious for once. I forgot how amazing it feels not to feel like I‚Äôm going to lose control.

Edit: Holy crap the amount of support and awards are so overwhelming! Thank you so much everyone! I hope everything goes amazing for everyone, anxiety is horrible and nobody deserves to have it. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit 2: While I didn‚Äôt list this as something that helped, I watch a channel called Bad Lip Reading which is a channel who puts movies, politics, etc and takes out the audio, then puts their own audio in based on lip reading. It ends up making no sense which makes me laugh. Here‚Äôs a [Star Wars](https://youtu.be/Sv_hGITmNuo) video that I watch all the time. Any time I feel anxious, the person behind those videos makes me laugh so hard that I forget about it. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll help anyone, but I figured I‚Äôd link it just in case it could help someone else like myself. :)

Post 574: Fuck Anxiety. I Am Legend.
Content:
I had an explosive panic attack yesterday that shot up my heart rate and blood pressure. I almost passed out. But guess what. I slept for 12 hours, and got right back into the thick of life! I refuse to crumble every time anxiety gets to me. I am a functional anxious motherfucker. But I'm also a warrior and will not back down! Stay hard!

Post 575: Anyone else rewatch the same shows over and over?
Content:
This past year has been tough on all of us I‚Äôm sure. I know I have been having an extremely difficult time with managing my anxiety. One thing that I recently noticed I do when I‚Äôm anxious is I rewatch shows or movies. It‚Äôs not something new, but its something I realized just now. I have rewatched The Regular Show in it‚Äôs entirety for the 4th time now as well as a handful of other shows. I have watched my favorite Disney films again and again over the course of this past year. One impressive feat (for me at least) is I have watched all of South Park 3 times now lol. It‚Äôs something that feels familiar to me I suppose so it helps calm me down? You‚Äôd think out of the thousands and perhaps millions of viewing options available on streaming services, I would watch something else. Just wondering if anyone else has these tendencies as well.

Post 576: I had a package accidentally delivered to my neighbor
Content:
Like the title says, I had a package accidentally delivered to my neighbors house instead of mine. Normally I would have stressed over it for days, getting super anxious about the idea of knocking on a strangers door (we just moved into the neighborhood a few months ago and haven‚Äôt met many neighbors), and eventually get so anxious about how long it‚Äôs been that I just never even get the package at all. But today I just took a deep breath, went over to the neighbors house, and knocked on their door. He answered right away and was very nice and gave me my package! And, bonus- now I know one more neighbor. 

Anyways this sounds like a silly win, but for me it feels like big progress. I‚Äôm proud of myself today


Edit: wow, the support in this community is so inspiring! Thanks everyone, I‚Äôve never gotten awards before, I was weirdly emotional after seeing them.

Post 577: I called out of work today!
Content:
Well, not called, but I emailed my supervisors this morning and told them I needed to take a mental health day and they said okay! I get to rest my brain!

EDIT: update my supervisor called me to check in on me and my heart is so full! All I can hope for is that more and more people will understand this and make work better for us folks with anxiety.

Post 578: Having anxiety is exhausting.
Content:
So much time and mental energy goes into worrying over every little thing.

What‚Äôs it like to be someone who can just have an interaction and walk away clean? What‚Äôs it like to be someone who doesn‚Äôt lie awake at night terrified?

I‚Äôd like to find out.

Post 579: Who else is in their mid-late 20's and has hardly experienced life and never "go out"?
Content:
It's really bothering me that I let my mental health own me so much. I am 26 and don't do anything fun. It's no wonder I am depressed. I never go to bars or clubs or have a group of friends to hangout with. I don't have any hobbies that'd help me meet people. I am doing nothing right towards socializing. I work and hang at home with my family. That's all i do. 

Who else is missing out on life and meeting people?

Post 580: Does anyone else use "lol/haha" after texts to seem less harsh?
Content:
I've noticed that when I text someone I often put "lol" or "haha" at the end so I don't seem serious or come across in a harsh way. It's kind of excessive. It makes me anxious thinking I might be too serious/forward/harsh in texts even though when other people text normally it doesn't make me feel like that as the receiver

Edit: Woke up and glad to realize a lot of us are in the same boat, lol 

Post 581: I wish I could have a surgery to get rid of this fucking anxiety

I've done so much work to get where I am and it never gets easier, it never gets better, it never heals and it never stops being hard. Compared to what I was a few years ago I am so far ahead... but it's fucking exhausting, I feel like every I have a weight around my neck.  If I could get a surgery to have a part of my brain removed I would do it, even if it took away a part of me I would do it

Post 582: I ate after 5 days.
Content:
I knew it was time to eat. I have emetophobia ( the fear of vomit ) & it has stopped me from eating for the last 5 days.

Today, I was going to go another day without eating to avoid a panic attack. But enough was enough.

I had a few fries, a chicken nugget & 3 bites of a burger. It wasn't much, but it was something & I'm so happy. 

It was hard to swallow & chew, but I managed to do so calmly :) I go to the doctors tommorow to get anxiety medication as well!!

UPDATE : I got the medication. Before taking it, I was having mini snacks like smoothies & crisps. Then for dinner my mum brought home KFC & I could barely eat it. So I decided to take the first pill, very worried.

At first I was confused as to how to feel about it, I just felt numb. But then I started eating, without a thought in my head. No nausea, no dry throat, no rapid heartbeat. I ate my first BIG meal & feel no guilt. I truly feel like I've found myself again. I started singing again, listening to music, writing & socialising with my friends.

Post 583: Consumed by regret after missing out on life for 26 years.
Content:
I am 26 and have not lived. I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (<3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home. Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships. I struggle to convince myself it's not too late to live, and that if I manage to, the rest of my life will not be plagued by current regrets.

You know it's stupid. 

You know with all your heart that it wasn't a big deal and that it should roll off of you.

Suddenly the small things is very big and it keeps growing in your head, and trying to escape from under skin.

You know with all of your heart that you're being ridiculous and You hate every minute of it.

Post 588: I AM FINALLY STARTING THERAPY !
Content:
So it only took me 14 months to take the steps necessary to start, i think it is going to go well but i want to avoid being too excited. Over the past two months there have been things that i have done regarding my social anxiety that would be considered progress but i think that this is the first real step. I would appreciated if anyone with experience could tell me what i can expect. Other than the fact that it obviously will not magically solve all my problems that much i already know don't worry i won't be disappointed.

EDIT: Damn it i still have anxiety regarding posting i thought i had that figured out.

Post 589: Does anyone else get nauseous when they get anxious but become scared of throwing up so it gets stuck on a loop?
Content:
My anxiety is most commonly tied to my stomach. When I become really anxious (for no reason just because), I'll become nauseous (along with other symptoms). Except, while most people are scared of vomiting, I'm petrified. I have gone into panic attacks because I feel nauseous. I will do *anything* not to vomit even though I know it's completely irrational and stupid. I haven't been diagnosed with any phobia, but I'm pretty sure it is a phobia. Anyways, this anxiety will make me nauseous, and then nausea will make me more anxious until I'm in a feedback loop. It's sort of paralyzing, especially since I have GAD and GERD, so I am constantly in fear of throwing up. 

Anyone else?

People make mistakes and not everyone is going to be happy with you all of the time, I need to learn how to bounce back and go back to getting work done not sit here and cry uncontrollably for almost an hour.

Post 595: Anyone else feel a need to just get away from their life?
Content:
Not just in the sense of stay at home in bed but to actually get out and find an ideal looking wilderness to just stay in. No phone, no contact with anyone other than someone or something you choose to bring with you and no concerns or responsibilities.

Hopefully I'd build a cabin, live off the land and just stay there with my partner (and maybe a dog) with everything that we need around us. There wouldn't be the need to talk to anyone else, no unecessary conversations and no awkward silences to make my anxiety go through the roof trying to think of what to say.

I've suffered with Social Anxiety, General Anxiety and Depression for most of my life and have always felt more at peace and happier when out in the wilderness and cut off from everybody else.

Post 596: I‚Äôve started therapy for my anxiety
Content:
I just wanted to tell someone, just anyone.

Its like talking to someone and telling them about stuff you cant explain to other people. The fact that i‚Äôm doing it makes me feel better.

I finally got the guts to talk to a therapist after 2 years. It was definitely there for longer, but i noticed it was getting worse 2 years ago. I got my guts together and i took the plunge last week.

Just wanted to put it out there somewhere since i dont want to tell anyone i know yet

Edit: Oh wow, so many of you responded and upvoted, I'm in complete awe! It means so much to me! Thank you so much!

**Edit #2: I WISH ALL OF YOU THE BEST IN YOUR LIVES! YOU'VE ALL MADE MY DAY!**

Edit #3: I'm so happy i posted here! I felt so alone because I hadnt told anyone and you guys are so nice! I cant even describe how happy I am! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

Edit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.

You need therapy in all cases of anxiety. 

You do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms

And your first therapist might not be amazing. You have to search for one that fits you. You need to experiment with therapists till you find one for you, and when you do, have faith and trust in them!

Post 597: Does anyone else feel intense anxiety about having kids in the current world/political/economic climate?
Content:
I want kids. I've always wanted to be a parent. I'm fortunate enough to be in the financial position to do this reasonably well. 

All of that aside, it almost feels unethical to bring new life into the world as it is. I guess looking back on history, this is still in a lot of ways one of the easiest times to be alive... but I just can't get over this intense anxiety that things are about to get so much worse and that my children's future will just be, well, awful. 

Does anyone else with anxiety struggle with this?

EDIT: OMG. The amount of people who have responded with something along the lines of: "ThIs iSnT AnXiEtY iT iS ReALitY"... do you even deal with anxiety on a day to day basis? Many people with generalized anxiety disorder or just higher than normal anxiety, worry most about things that are indeed a part of reality...? The level of worry is usually just greater than people who don't deal with anxiety on a clinical level... YOU CAN BE ANXIOUS ABOUT REALITY LOL.

Post 598: I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday
Content:
First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to "give me back."

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry. There is nothing I can do to feel better.

Post 603: I quit my six-figure job to recover
Content:
This was possibly the hardest decision I‚Äôve ever had to make. I‚Äôve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn‚Äôt stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn‚Äôt taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I‚Äôm a quitter?

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don‚Äôt have a fully laid out plan of what I‚Äôm going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I am by no means on the other side yet but I thought I would put this out into the world for anyone else who feels stuck in their job and afraid to quit. Feel free to DM.

UPDATE: Writing this update on 10 June 2022 (a week out from 1 year ago). Thank you to everyone that commented at the time. Your encouragement really helped me through a tough time. Over the past year I have consistently received private messages from people that have gone through or are currently going through the same situation.

At the time of my original post I felt so alone because I couldn‚Äôt find other people going through the same thing. I thought I would just be sending a rant into a black hole and it wouldn‚Äôt mean much but it has really been worth putting out there just to see how many people have reached out and the conversations that have come from it. 

As an update, I took 2 glorious months off and looking back, quitting was the best decision I ever made. I was ashamed and guilty for a while but I had the gift of TIME. To do things I wanted to do that had nothing to do with work and to heal. Of course I had incredible support so I could focus on building myself back up. I‚Äôm now back at work at a previous job (before the heinous one referred to above) and I‚Äôm doing well. I still have anxiety obviously but off anti-depressants now.

If you‚Äôre ever in the same broken state I was, I know that hesitation so well. I know its a tough decision but I still 100% recommend quitting. A career is not the entirety of life.

Post 604: Does anyone else avoid the news these days?
Content:
Hi, all. Is anyone else having to almost completely avoid the news right now? I almost feel like it's "attacking" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels & frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We "have" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time & we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of "fake news". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

(I'm not saying I don't take Covid seriously, btw - I do. I wear a mask on the rare occasions I go out and keep my distance.)

Post 606: Booked my COVID vaccine for tomorrow. Could someone reassure me I‚Äôm doing the right thing?
Content:
My anxiety has been a living nightmare lately. The talk of vaccines and Covid has also been mentally draining me, and I feel so scared. 

I finally booked my vaccine, because I know I need to pick between this vaccine or this illness. 

As a mom, I feel I need to be strong and I need to vaccinate myself to limit the spread. 

I have so much health anxiety lately. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to have an anxiety attack and think the symptoms of anxiety are side effects of the vaccine. 

I just need reminders and reassurance I‚Äôm doing the right thing. That I‚Äôm going to be okay and still be able to be a mom. 
I‚Äôm such a mess right now. These thoughts are so intrusive. 

I am hoping once I receive it, and side effects go away, that I will feel better. I hope I will feel protected and more safe. 
I just want a break from this anxiety.

Content:
I'm not a hoarder per definition (I don't think), but I do have a lot of stuff. Many things I don't really know what to do with. Hobby stuff from parents, old school books etc....they saved too many things. I also have several projects started but never finished.

There is a lot of nostalgia attached to these items, so they also feel comforting in a way.

But I've started to think if I may reduce my anxiety by simplifying, as the things also seem to take up a lot of mental energy for me.

I notice when I've been out biking/walking that my anxiety increases a lot when coming back to my house.

Do you have any experience of this or any suggestions? Thx.

Post 610: Got cured of Generalized Anxiety Disorder! Here's what worked for me!
Content:
Hey guys, I have been an avid follower of this sub for a long time and this place has been a constant source of panic attack relievers over the last few months. In my last session with my therapist, he told me that GAD is cured after 6 months of literal hell and dedication. I want to share what worked for me.

**Background:** As with my fellow GAD sufferers, I have been suffering from constant worries and usual panic attacks over the last few years but I decided to take action about this (didn't know it was GAD back then) after a full-blown attack that lasted for hours and hours in early May this year. Started my treatment late May. In one of the panic attacks I was contemplating committing suicide but thank god I had the courage to stick to my routine.

**Symptoms:** Luckily, never had any physical symptoms but diarrohea and mouth ulcers were common because of cortisol developed by Amygdala.

**Aftermath:** I am waking up everyday with a buoyant mood and my life including social life, dating life and academic performance, all have improved!

So, let's finally begin:

1. **Therapy:** Can't emphasize this more, CBT therapists will identify the problematic and impractical thought patterns associted with your Anxiety( especially if it's Cortex-based) and suggest you ways to cope with them via ABCDE, RRR techniques and so on. Some of these will work for you will and some not but these people are medical experts and you need to spend 2-3 months with a therapist before deciding to discontinue/move to a different Therapist. Self-therapy books do help but it's always better to have someone in the form of close friend or a therapist to assist in your journey.
2. **Reading Books:** Rewire your Anxious Brain, The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety, and My Age of Anxiety,  are the top 3 books I recommend. Finally, I'd suggest reading posts on this sub. **Caution:** there are chances of feeling uneasiness or having panic attacks by reading few content so make sure you tell your brain that this is medicine beforehand
3. **Meditation:** atleast 2-3 times in a day for 12.5 mins everyday. It's only one day in the last 6 months I missed doing this wonderful thing.Buddhist style of meditation worked for me. Mantra meditation, guided meditation are other alternatives. There are wide variety of resources available online. It could be possible that you don't see the effects in the initial few weeks but I'd suggest keep doing it blindly.
4. **Gym:**  6 days a week non-stop in the last 6 months except for the weeks when I was travelling. It's scientifically proven that doing physical activity for more than 20 mins almost everyday improves mental health. Technically, doing exercises helps the body release endorphins that rearrange the synapse between the neurons if done for 10 weeks to see a significant results. This is massive in improving thought patterns
5. **Being open:** Being open about your anxiety with your closed ones will enable to learn new strategies, perspectives and many more things. More importantly, you will have shoulders to fall upon during a full-blown panic attack

**Others:** practicing gratitude daily, practicing my hobbies( soccer).

Post 619: Anyone else getting really anxious with all the COVID restrictions lifting?
Content:
I am slowly realizing where my anxiousness has come from over the last couple of days. I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again.... 

How are you guys handling going back to some form of "normal" or "before"?

Post 620: PSA: Ambient background videos on YouTube have helped my anxiety tremendously. I think you should all give it a try.
Content:
I'm not sure how I stumbled across these videos (and I won't link any since I don't want people to think I'm spamming), but if you search for ambient background videos, they're pretty awesome. I work from home and they've helped my anxiety tremendously.  
 
For example, you can search things like "Rain city background" or "medieval town ambiance" or "crackling fireplace and rain background", a lot of YouTubers have uploaded thousands of videos that you can just leave playing in the background.  Last night I slept to an International Space Station ambient video.  

Sometimes what I like to do is black out all the blinds, turn off the lights, and play some haunted house fireplace ambient video. It's just so relaxing.

You know what the worst thing about anxiety is?


How lonely you feel during it. We all experience it on our own and even if someone is next to you, they still don‚Äòt feel the same fear as you do in that moment.


All of us have to process our emotions and impressions by ourselves and that thought alone makes me feel so lonely.


The way I‚Äòm shaking right now because I am so scared, no one is here and awake. I‚Äòm crying and even if they were awake they couldn‚Äòt help me because the fear is deeply rooted inside of me.


I just want a break man, I‚Äòm tired of feeling like dying over things that have many solutions to it.

Hawaii isn‚Äôt some cure for my mental health issues (and I just say Hawaii because I live in the US).   
 But I saw this documentary about HAPPINESS and it was about who the happiest people in the world seem to be.

Simple life living, no bullshit societal stipulations that f\*\*\* with your head‚Ä¶. just the sound of a breeze, the crashing of waves, and the beautiful sunny landscape filled with the stillness of nature. 

Maybe no one relates to this. 

Maybe this is just wishful thinking. 

Maybe it‚Äôs just the concept of ‚Äúif I‚Äôm going to feel like hell, I might as well feel it in an absolutely breathtaking place where things are just a lot more chill and peaceful.

Post 624: After not leaving the house in 4 years..
Content:
I can‚Äôt stop smiling right now! In June it will be 4 years since I left my house and today I went to the Home Depot and made a purchase!!!! Walking to the car to leave felt like I was walking into a war zone! It‚Äôs not far from my house but there is a couple traffic lights that scare the shit out of me, not to mention it‚Äôs the freakin Home Depot on a Saturday morningüò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨.  It was not easy and I thought I was gonna loose it a few times (and almost did) but I somehow kept it together. I am just so proud of myself right now and needed somewhere to say it!  There is hope out thereüôèüèª.

Edit:  WOW, silver and gold!, thank you all so much, I can‚Äôt tell you how happy I am from all the support. I am literally having the best day!!!!! 

 Brief history of how I got to this state in comments...

Post 625: I'm about to start the first job I've had in 7 years and I'm freaking out eeeeeek
Content:
I'm 32, and I'm on disability for anxiety and other physical stuff. After 7 years I'm trying to see if I can handle it, so got a part time janitorial job. I'm so excited and so freaked out. Eek. Wish me luck guys.
EDIT/UPDATE: first day was crazy, I puked beforehand,  but I did it, and I survived,it was an easy uneventful time, so I did it the next day.... I puked then too....... I have to work again soon... think I'm going to go puke now. I might always puke before work, but I think I can handle this :D

Post 626: I GOT A JOB!
Content:
The past 6 months my agoraphobia had gotten so bad that I avoided leaving my house completely. A few days ago I decided to start applying for jobs. I had an interview today and after having 2 panic attacks about it and fighting my fears for hours, I went. 

The interview went so well that they wanted me to fill a different position that would be way more interesting, pay more, and I‚Äôd have my own office. I was hired on the spot. 

Needed to share this with somewhere. Don‚Äôt have a lot of friends lol:)

Update: 
Thank you for the silver‚ù§Ô∏è I had my first day today and it was awesome. My manager is great.

Post 627: Today I ate in a restaurant by myself
Content:
I‚Äôve had anxiety for around 6 years now, sometimes it is more debilitating than others and I‚Äôve had a phobia of choking on my food for the past 3 years. Eating out tends to be a really difficult process for me even when I‚Äôm in company I‚Äôm comfortable with, I‚Äôll often end up giving up and not finishing my meal because I think I‚Äôm going to choke on every mouthful. I‚Äôve never eaten in a restaurant on my own in my life. 

Today though I thought ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù I‚Äôm not living my life around this fear anymore, so I popped into a small Thai restaurant near my home for lunch. I sat at my table and I ordered some food and I ate. It was overwhelmingly liberating, I could have cried. It wasn‚Äôt easy to eat but I finished my plate and I‚Äôve never been more proud of myself.

Post 628: Guys I made it to the gym today!!
Content:
After having signed up (online) in October!

Edit to add: I've now gone THREE days in a row! I even used TWO machines!!!!

Post 629: The little anxiety podcast I cohost just hit 10k downloads. I'm sure comparatively that's nothing, but it still feels pretty damn good!
Content:
I just don't have another space to share this kind of stuff, so wanted to share it here! We've also been consistent in releasing our content, which I'm proud of my cohost and I for, since there were plenty of times we could have reasonably justified not recording etc. 

Anyway, it took us about six months to accomplish that, which is pretty neat! Wild to think that people felt the urge to tune in ten thousands separate times! 

Honestly, during this super messed up time, which I know has been so damn hard for all of us, I'm just trying to focus on silver linings, and this feels like one to me.

EDIT: Hey! A lot of people are asking me for a link to the podcast - sorry for the delay! It‚Äôs called ‚Äú[I‚Äôm Anxious About](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/im-anxious-about-a-humorous-podcast-about-anxiety/id1513328863?fbclid=IwAR3didtiHxUoU6IZYV4m-vFsbrFeKXH4MftnQkQWA7nRj9B8MP3I1usgdsQ)‚Äù :)

Post 630: Self-checkout line is the best thing to have happened to humanity

Your girl just wants to go to the grocery store at 11 PM without having to interact with anyone and it could be a reality thanks to this magical invention. Yay.

Just the thought of it is relieving honestly.

Post 631: I went to the bakery alone!!!
Content:
I'm 17 and basically can't do anything by myself. If there's no one with me when I go outside, I completely freeze up. But this morning my mom was sick so she slept a little longer. I went to the bakery all by myself and even managed to order a coffee to go :)

This is such a silly thing to be proud of, I know. But it's a big step for me. Anxiety has ruined so much, but things like this make me realize that I've improved - no matter how little.

Edit: thank you so much for all the nice comments! And I thought my day couldn't get any better :D I hope that every single one of you keeps celebrating your small but important victories!

Post 632: Is it normal that my psychiatrist basically FREAKED out on me for being 4 minutes late to my appointment?
Content:
They burst into the waiting room and said, "Come ON, you are late! I have a very tighy and strict schedule!"

They then proceeded to RUN down halls ways and corners to their office. Since this was my first in person visit, I also had to run to keep up with them, since I had no idea where their office was.

They roughly take my vitals while saying "I am a very punctual person. I have 2 other clients to see in 8 minutes, so we will have to make this quick."

By this time, I am basically hyperventilating and near tears, apologizing fervently and seeping into an oncoming panic attack.

They are asking 100 questions and not listening to my answers. Shouts out some random antidepressant I haven't tried yet and says, "I'll call it in. Start it when you get it. Next  visit is telehealth, sign on at LEAST 15 minutes early to make sure your not late." (This was my first time being late. I've been seeing them for 9 months.)

Then they shuffle me out the door.
I sat in the parking lot crying for 30 minutes.

Post 633: I‚Äôm shaking. My heart is pounding. My hands are tingling. I have a presentation to do.
Content:
And I‚Äôm gonna do it so fucking well. Idgaf how anxious I am, I have this shit memorized, I‚Äôve practiced it over and over again, and I‚Äôm not gonna fail.

UPDATE: It went well! Voice was shaky but I still spoke loudly! Thank you for your words of encouragement, it means a lot <3

Post 634: I haven't self harmed in one whole year.
Content:
The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain <3

Merry Christmas guys x

Post 635: Does anyone else feel like their friends and family secretly hate them and so you are terrified to talk to them and make things worse but you‚Äôre probably just being paranoid?
Content:
Just me? I feel like all of my friends actually don‚Äôt like me and ‚Äúput up with me,‚Äù or that every good relationship I‚Äôve ever had I‚Äôve ruined‚Äîeven though when I‚Äôm being rational I don‚Äôt see anything terribly wrong that I‚Äôve done. I just feel so much anxiety around them, as if my every move could ruin another friendship. Or I get so anxious that I disappear from the friendship entirely and that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt like me anymore, because I abandoned them. It eats up at me. I‚Äôm so afraid to hang out with my friends because I‚Äôm afraid they will think badly of me, but then our friendship drifts apart.

Post 636: I‚Äôm very grateful for my cat
Content:
It‚Äôs 2:00am and I just woke up in a panic. This happens at least 3 times a week. My heart is racing and I‚Äôm breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. Initially I don‚Äôt know why- probably a nightmare but I can‚Äôt remember what I was dreaming about. Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don‚Äôt know what I would do without her. She does this when I‚Äôm awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

This will probably get buried but I just wanted to share. 

Post 637: does anyone get really scared of being yelled at?
Content:
One of the biggest fears of my life is getting scolded. I fear getting scolded more than I fear my future career. Even if I know, deep down, that the other person is nice and probably understanding, I get so nervous about it that it affects my ability to do work. I submitted something in late and I was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that I paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. It's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. 

I was scolded once by a strict coach when I was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it. After that one encounter, I was so scared that I would get heart palpitations and have to be physically forced to go to practice. 

Post 638: I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me
Content:
It‚Äôs so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It‚Äôs just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I‚Äôve made immense progress but it‚Äôs never going to be normal again. I can‚Äôt stop feeling guilty for everything I‚Äôve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I‚Äôm worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can‚Äôt let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn‚Äôt even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I‚Äôm tired of thoughts that I‚Äôm a horrible person. I‚Äôm just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I‚Äôm in a group of people having fun. And I‚Äôm able to make them laugh. Whenever I‚Äôm alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I‚Äôm worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there‚Äôs gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It‚Äôs just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I‚Äôm kinda thinking this might be because I‚Äôve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I‚Äôm so nervous I can‚Äôt stop hyper focusing on one situation and it‚Äôs been a year and it wasn‚Äôt even a big deal when it happened

What helps me calm down is my routine of checking if people have blocked me or not (nobody has blocked me so far) and window shopping on Mercari for squishmallows with factory errors.

Post 639: Society treats those with anxiety like garbage
Content:
I've seen how most people treat someone whose anxious. Society treats those who are anxious or timid like garbage, play things to troll and fuck with. It's not just young people who bully those who are anxious, there's a culture of not taking anxious people seriously, not at all trying to sympathize with reasons why they might be that way.

People are animals, if you show even the slightest nervousness they pounce, they double down and try to stress you more, or laugh at you, ect. I've seen this from young, middle aged and old, from people of all cultures and background, it's absolutely disgraceful.

Suicide rates don't surprise me at all.

Post 640: Finally decided to woman up and visit a psychiatrist today and got told that I had severe anxiety and panic disorder and should've visited sooner. Hopefully will get my life back on track. My mind has exhausted me.
Content:
My brother said I deserved it for acting up idk what that even means but it hurt. You gotta take care of yourself cause even your family doesn't always care.

Post 641: First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend
Content:
My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went "are you okay?"

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said "I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack"

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said "Mom's sad. Give her love" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it

Post 642: Guys‚Äîfor the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.
Content:
I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there‚Äôs no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like ‚Äúoh no you don‚Äôt!‚Äù I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy‚Äînamely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I‚Äôm so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you‚Äôve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this! We don‚Äôt have to be anxiety‚Äôs bitch! And that‚Äôs the best feeling in the entire world.

Post 643: Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am right now.
Content:
Hands shaking, heart pounding, I told the guy at TSA that I had never flown alone and he reassured me that they were always there to help. Hands still shaking and heart still pounding, I went through TSA keeping a close eye on my valuables. A little less shakily, I found my gate.  Waiting to board. I have never been more proud of myself than I am right now. 

Post 644: Does anyone else intentionally act a bit dumber just to avoid having to talk too much in conversations?
Content:
Sometimes maybe say if you were in a conversation with someone/people you‚Äôre not comfortable with and you will not offer your whole stance on a topic or even sometimes act like you know nothing (when you do) just to avoid to have to talk, or come off the wrong way

There are times where I will just say ‚Äúwhy‚Äù but I know full well why, just so I can avoid offering anything else on the topic. 

Obviously I don‚Äôt know everything.. most of the time I don't know anything.. but when I do know something I'll just avoid speaking just for comfortability sake

Post 645: Have you ever snapped at someone, felt immense guilt after, and worried that something bad was gonna happen to you because of it?
Content:
Today I was unnecessarily rude to a stranger because my stress levels were at 1000%. Immediately I felt so guilty because this person did not deserve that. I didn't have a chance to apologize to this person and now I'm worried something terrible will happen to me because of my stupid action.

Post 646: Happy World Mental Health day everyone!
Content:
I hope you all have an anxiety free day

Post 647: To whoever needs this right now, you've got this, you're gonna be okay. This too, shall pass. Stay strong and stay safe, my friend. Please feel free to DM me to vent or talk about anything. May you be happy and well. :)

Much love.

Post 648: Anyone else get anxiety over just making a Reddit post?
Content:
It seems when I want to post something, I'm excited about it because it's a subject of interest and I want to discuss it. But then when I post it and get replies..there's always at least one person who is really rude and implies that whatever Im talking about is dumb. 

Then I get anxiety. I get defensive at times too. Sometimes I get close to deleting the post because I don't like people disrespecting me when I know damn well I don't deserve it

Post 649: This shit is so terrifying
Content:
I cant stop crying 

I just want to calm down but i cant

I fucking cant 

Im afraid all the time and i cant stop 

Every thought is like an explosion in my brain 

It's like the world is trying to devour me

I just want this to stop but it always comes back, always 

I know its such self pitying bullshit but I cannot convince myself that anyone really likes me, no matter what they say, being alive is just so tiring 

I treat EVERYTHING like a freaking personal attack 
I twist every postive, kind thing the people in my life do for me and turn it into something absolutely unrecognizable

Its disgusting

I cannot make a right decision 

Posting this is wrong 

But I dont know what else to do?

But its wrong 

Writing this out has kind of been therapeutic so there's that? 

Its either I write this freakout to reddit because all other social media is terrifying rn (and people i know inhabit those, ew) or I keep scrolling through the apps on my phone endlessly while I hyperventilate 

I shall add another sad voice to the void, enjoy.
Thank you for reading.
Any helpful tips to deal would be appreciated.
I hope you all are not feeling as panicky as I am :')

Edit: seriously so thankful you all have been leaving so many nice comments :') (and even gave me a gold?? Thank you!) I may not respond to everyone but I am surely reading every comment and am beyond appreciative!

Post 650: Anxiety robbed me of my personality
Content:
And the more I think of this, the more depressed I feel that anxiety has become such a huge part of my life that I forget who I am without it. The person I was without anxiety seems so different and distant. I miss her. I miss her so much.

Post 651: Who has social anxiety or panic disorder but seems completely normal on the outside?
Content:
I Have a bit of social anxiety at certain times and my panic disorder comes on every so often as well. But from the outside I seem completely normal even like mid panic attack. I‚Äôm just curious to know how many other people I interact with on a daily basis that are working and living and doing things but still struggling immensely with anxiety ?

Post 652: Does anyone here also worry they are cringey/annoying all the time?
Content:
I feel insecure and worry that Im not funny just cringey. People have told me Im cringey online but I just eant to know how to not be cringey. Any advice?

I also have a lot of self hate and self doubt. "Youll never be good enough."

I just feel so embarassed and ashamed of myself.

Of course Im sure everyone does something cringey once in a while... Im just worrying way to much. 

Thanks for reading

Edit: thank you all for your wonderful advice. Happy holidays and have a great day!

Post 653: Does anyone just wonder at the end of a long day: "dang, I really have to do this all again tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that...?
Content:
Sometimes always being stressed out makes the days seem so much longer. I guess I just wish I could have a break from my anxiety. It really sucks because you have to go to bed knowing you're literally walking right into another stressful day, but like, what choice do we have?

Post 654: Today is my cake day AND my actual birthday.
Content:
And for several years I‚Äôve down played my birthday because of anxiety. Anxious about the attention. Anxious about organising a party and no one coming, anxious about everyone forgetting. So I‚Äôve just not told people it‚Äôs my birthday and I‚Äôve not organised anything. 

But this year I did tell people at my work. I told people who I‚Äôve made friends with online, I went out for a meal. 

It has been a great day and I think it‚Äôs the first time in a long time I‚Äôve really enjoyed my birthday. It also feel great to have let down a wall.


Edit: thanks for all the birthday messages :) love you all.

Post 655: Does anyone else get anxiety over replying to messages/emails?
Content:
For awhile now I've been feeling anxiety around replying to messages and emails, even simple ones, like with friends. I keep avoiding and delaying answering, which funnily enough stresses me out even more because now I'm replying late.

Has anyone else experienced this before? How did you deal with it?

Post 656: When the day is over, let it go. Don't dwell on what you could've or should've done. Tomorrow is another day and another chance. If it's meant to be, it will come again.
Content:
No worry can change the past, it serves you no purpose to dwell on things that cant be changed.  Tomorrow is a new day and new opportunity to change how you see and live your life.  

How you chose to view the affects of your past rest purely with you and your perspective on life.  Try find the positives in what comes your way in order to break any negative trends you may have created.

When you find harmony and good in things around you, you'll find yourself.  We have to break the cycle off negativity in our lives in order to be open to the good around us.

Positivity breeds positivity.

I wish everyone happiness in all that you do.

Post 657: Hey YOU
Content:
Yes. YOU. The person reading this right now. You're amazing. I'm telling you because you probably don't hear it as much as you deserve to. Because you're battling some really tough things that most people won't ever understand. Because even though you're doing that, and it's hell, you're STILL HERE. I don't know if you realize what a major accomplishment that is, but I'm here to tell you, it's fucking incredible. You're INCREDIBLE. Keep fighting. Keep going. It's going to be okay. I know it doesn't feel like it sometimes (or a lot of the time), but it really will. You're going to have glorious moments of sunshine to make all this rain worth it. Those moments are going to see you through the storms. Because there will be storms. Maybe you're in the storm right now. You'll get through it. Because you're strong, stronger than you think you are. You're incredible and strong, and I know you can do it. I have faith in you. I'm here for you. 
YOU. ARE. AMAZING.

I wish I could believe in religion to give me comfort but I just don‚Äôt believe in it. I guess the best thing I heard was from the show House. He gets shot almost dies and when he wakes up his friend is like. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to take a new take on life now?‚Äù He replies. ‚ÄúNo. Cause if I was dead I would never know it, so I‚Äôm here. Who cares‚Äù. Oddly gives me some little bit of comfort.

Post 661: Please stop medication shaming
Content:
This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are "oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you." Or "oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like "oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know." She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her "oh so you dropped one addiction for another." Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's "help" or "advice" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*

Post 662: I brushed my teeth!
Content:
Hi, everyone.

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth. 

I'm crying because I finally did it. My teeth might just be saved.

Post 664: Today is my twelfth day sleeping on time and eating all 5 meals
Content:
Well, 2 weeks ago I made a post on this sub, venting a bit what was going through my mind at the time.
I was very anxious and stressed, eating poorly and very little even sometimes just once a day. My nights were very particular, sometimes sleeping less than 4 hours a day every day.

Today concludes the second week in which I sleep early and wake up comfortably. Besides complying with 5 meals a day, especially breakfast which I missed SO MUCH.
I went back to exercising, playing the guitar, playing chess online.

I still have a lot to do, and although the current situation is not the best I can say that I am ready to go back to work with a positive mindset!

Post 667: People don't understand what anxiety is
Content:
People don't understand what the impact of an anxiety disorder really is.

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel "normal" again.

All wounds will heal with time but it sucks we have to go through this terrifying traumatic experience.

Post 670: Does anyone that has dealt with depression /anxiety pre Covid19 feel even more out-of-sync with their peers even tho ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù is struggling with mental health, sadness and anxiety?
Content:
I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if it‚Äôs just me. Some days I feel supercharged and extra supportive of my friends who are struggling and don‚Äôt respond to texts, video calls, online game sessions, invitations to virtually hang out, not being invited to virtual gatherings between friends, etc. I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI get it, that‚Äôs ok, I understand because I know what depression is like...‚Äù

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel ‚Äúgod I must be so terrible, that‚Äôs why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others‚Äù 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like ‚ÄúHmm tbh I haven‚Äôt really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don‚Äôt ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that‚Äôs cool. But if they don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not reading into it.‚Äù

All of that sounds extremely healthy and understandable, so I repeat the cycle again. I can‚Äôt seem to feel normal in this world. It‚Äôs like dancing off beat all the time. I feel like most of my life I have been unselfishly receptive to what others are struggling with (since I‚Äôve been there so long).

I just don‚Äôt know how to relate I guess.

Post 671: Just fucking hug me
Content:
I sit here on a Sunday evening, anxious out of my mind. I have work obligations that I'm starting to fail. I'm exhausted, I'm tired I don't want to continue like this.

I'm sick of being alone, I'm sick of having no one. Having said that, I know it's my own fault. After the abuse I suffered I closed off, and closed everyone else out. I've been lonely, and have suffered alone for 10 years now.

I now realize that all people aren't out to get me, that life without people to share it with is pointless. So now I pray. I pray that the world that I closed off would take me back.

Edit: Thanks everyone, you've made the evening 4x better!

Post 672: Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?
Content:
I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few "productive" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program

Post 673: Does anybody else feel tightness in the chest and sinking feeling every morning before an "event"...ANY event?
Content:
Tl:dr: Am I weird for waking up with a sinking feeling in my gut on my birthday? Or is this what excitement is?

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is "something" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special. Why the hell am I waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? Am I subconsciously excited about my birthday?

I haven't felt excited in a long time so maybe I have forgotten what it is?

Basically what the title says. I used to be scared to drive alone especially far and go places far away on my own without getting anxiety. But today it was growth. I drove all the way to downtown LA, went to the grand central market and confronted my agoraphobia (thanks Covid) and had dinner in a crowded place! Next I was able to attend a clipper game alone! And you know what? I had a good time!

Post 676: Has anyone else had a huge increase in anxiety since covid started/got worse in the US?
Content:
So I‚Äôve always had anxiety, but I‚Äôm usually able to function pretty normally. I‚Äôm 23, and working as an engineer. My company is part of a critical industry, so we‚Äôve been open, and I‚Äôve worked on site everyday since the pandemic began. At first I was fine, I just did my best to stay home when I wasn‚Äôt at work. Since the fall things have slowly been getting worse, I‚Äôm constantly worried that any slight change in how I feel is covid-related, and I‚Äôm terrified of being the reason someone I care about dies of covid. It‚Äôs affected my appetite, making me lose weight, made me cry much more often than ever before, and avoid seeing even the two friends I decided to share a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù with when this all began. Has anyone else experienced this? I don‚Äôt know what to do to control it or convince myself that I‚Äôm not sick when every week I have a new reason to think otherwise

Post 677: I was just harassed in public

This is why I hate going outside by myself. I simply went to get money out of a cash machine and in the parking lot there were a group of ‚Äòmen‚Äô loitering outside their van. They started talking about my ass and how they couldn‚Äôt stop staring at it, like I was a meat product. I tried quickly to get money out of the machine and on my way out one of them slaps my ass. I felt so humiliated I ran home taking a longer route to avoid walking past them again. I want to cry. I am going out for a work meal and now I feel like I am dressed too provocatively and every person is going to think I‚Äôm a slut. I am wearing trousers and a crop top because of the hot weather. My anxiety is through the roof, I just want to curl up in bed and never go outside again.

Edit: thank you all for such supportive and kind messages. It‚Äôs so nice to be reminded that the world isn‚Äôt full of horrible people. It made me cry how supportive you all are. Thank you for the suggestions that I should report these people, once my head is clear I will definitely do something about it. I don‚Äôt want anyone else to experience what I did.

For a very long time now any time there's a bad storm or something, it makes my anxiety go down so much. To the point I like to put on storm sounds when I sleep at night. I really don't get it, I was deathly afraid of storms when I was a kid. But I check the weather all the time to see when it's going to storm. I sleep better and even feel better and more energized all day. I hope I'm not alone.

Post 680: I always feel like I'm bothering people

Every time I think about messaging someone, I always think "Will they think I'm annoying?" or "Do they really even care?"

Every time I get the same feeling that I'm being annoying or bothering them.

I don't know what to do I'm too afraid to message old friends or just people in general.

Then there's the question "Will they think I don't care about them?" because of how little I message them and they don't know how hard it is for me to message them.

Am I just being a bitch? I can't bring myself to just message them, even though I want to.

Anyone got advice?

Post 684: Just one bad interaction can ruin my day. Anyone else?
Content:
It can be simple stuff but like the title says one bad interaction with someone can ruin my day. Example, Going out with my brother to a mall, we both suffer from Anxiety, his social anxiety been way worse than mine and all of the sudden we have some employee following us around and checking on us like we are going to steal something. Idk if they judge us for the clothes i wear or because i dnt look people in the eyes, most of the time i even wear earphones cause i dnt want people talking to me. Anyways my brother gets mad and say "WTF he is following us for?" And even if they don't say anything back for that moment on my brain just keep replaying that moment the rest of the day. Or been in the drive thru and asking for stuff and getting the wrong items or missing something over and over same thing happens, my brain just keep thinking about that situation. It gets annoying cause i can be having the best day and all of the sudden something like that happens and there goes my day. Anyone? Leave your story in the comments below.

Post 686: It's really hard to "be strong and carry on" when all I want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep.
Content:
I feel so tired and anxious right now, and I have so much to do, both at work and at home. There is no time to "be weak" or fall apart, because there's too much to do and too many expectations that I feel like I have to keep carrying on. 

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety. I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

More than anything, I want to live in a society where it's okay to be weak, it's okay to fall apart, it's okay to take time off of work, not because you're physically ill, but because you're mentally ill. Where bosses know how to support their employees who are mentally ill, and check in with them, and put structure around them that allows them to still continue on with work, but not feel scared they'll get fired if they keep calling out of work or have a bad day or react badly in a meeting because they're stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed.

I'm just tired and anxious and scared, and I want to be able to feel those things and know that the world will continue on. But I can't, I have to be strong and push it all down and "carry on," so that the world doesn't fall apart, and it makes my anxiety all the worse.

Hi everyone!

Please excuse me, I know this is a strange thing to talk about but I was recommended to pop it in here. Please remove it if it isn't allowed (and please excuse my gosh awful English!) !

For those who don't know me (which I'd imagine is everyone) I'm an ex-cook whose been dealing with depression on and off since I was 14.

Thanks to two very close friends I've been able to find ways around the lack of spoons to bring myself to cook again and I wanted to try and share the simple yet tasty recipes with people who share that same feeling.

Whilst it's a LONG way in development, I plan on it being a completely free release because it's only aim is to try and help people !

In the latest blog post there is a long(ish) list of things I will be adding, but I would love to know what kinds of recipes you guys would like to see simplified yet still just as tasty ! It can be anything, (even unhealthy ones as there is ways around it!) Vegan - Vegetarian - Meat feast or mixed!

I would also like to know if you believe this could actually be helpful. I have received some good feedback from those I pitched it to (although the website is not at all as far advanced as the book, I'm still working on that!) I would love to have a wider range of feedback than my own little circle !

To anyone that struggles, (this is really cliche) it does get better over time. It may not feel like you‚Äôre going anywhere, but I can guarantee that you are. Whether it be a small accomplishment or large, progress is being made.

Post 690: A cool anxiety technique I learned
Content:
**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself "This is my anxiety". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! 

Good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!

I came to my dorm today to find my roommate studying for his finals so we only greeted each other, I sat down and let him study. He didn't talk to me much either cus obviously, he was studying.

The whole time my conscious self knew that he's not talking to me because he's focused on whatever he was reading. My subconscious self tho, was yelling at me the whole time being like "He's pissed at you, you must have done something to upset him and he probably hates you for it!"

This happens more than I'm willing to admit. The fact that I'm completely socially incompetent and often misread social cues doesn't help at all. Anyone else like that?

Post 693: Huge victory, today I faced one of my biggest fears and got a panic attack in return. Took a train and it got stuck between two stations due to a technical problem. I considered pressing the emergency button and prying open the train door. Instead, I embraced the panic attack and pulled through.
Content:
I've suffered from a severe panic and anxiety disorder since i was 11. I'm 21 now, still suffering but going to a clinic soon to fix it. My worst fears are trains, busses, public places, small space and being surrounded by many people. I had an appointment at my new psychiatrist and i had to take the train, luckily it was only 2 stations away, 6 mins or so. So I got on the train and i felt surprisingly well. I actually felt great. Then the train suddenly stopped between 2 stations and i was stuck inside, no way out. Well one way out, pressing the emergency button and prying the door open which would have probably gotten me in a lot of trouble with the police. Panic hit me immediately after the the train stopped, i couldn't breathe and i felt like passing out any second. I got up and walked to the door and checked to see where the emergency button is. I actually considered pressing it. But the feeling of passing out completely overwhelmed me and i sat down on the floor and took deep breaths and tried to relax as best as i can. and guess what? It worked!! I survived the panic attack, i pulled through it and it feels f*cking amazing!! It gave me new hope and i actually believe that i'm able to overcome it. If you read everything, thank you! I just wanted to share my little victory with you :)

I wish I could learn to just let go of these things instead of them going around my head like a sock in a washing machine for the rest of the day...

Content:
Yesterday I wasn‚Äôt doing so well. I‚Äôm switching anxiety medications, so I‚Äôm going through a bit of withdrawal which isn‚Äôt fun. I thought about cancelling my dental appointment, but decided to go anyway. One of the nurses heard me state that I was having a bit of a panic attack, and I might need to do the x-rays another time. She took me back to the X-Ray room, and instead of prepping me for it, she told me that she had anxiety also, and she was willing to let me sit for a while to calm down. We talked for a while, and she told me I was very strong. She told me that she knows the struggles of anxiety as well, and they are very real. She actually started crying a bit, and I asked if I could hug her, which she accepted. 

After my appointment, I sat in my car for a while just thinking. I called my mom to tell her about it, and she started crying too. It‚Äôs nice to know I‚Äôm never alone.

It‚Äôs for a members only beach and all day for 7 hours straight I‚Äôm processing fees and bookings, letting people in and out of the lake, adding new members, answering emails, phone calls, and instructing ground staff when needed. I don‚Äôt have time to take ‚Äúofficial‚Äù breaks unless it‚Äôs not busy that day. If it is then I get almost no breaks from people. 

After two days in a row of work I‚Äôve completely broken down crying and hyperventilating, does this happen to anyone else in highly social jobs?

Post 703: Sometimes I can‚Äôt describe my symptoms, I just feel OFF
Content:
Does anyone else get this? Like you‚Äôre not exactly sure what you‚Äôre feeling but you know you don‚Äôt feel good. Everything is just slightly off and it‚Äôs distracting but it‚Äôs difficult to put your finger on or describe. I hate it.

Other times I have a more obvious physical symptom that‚Äôs at the forefront.

Post 704: I GOT THE FIRST DOSE OF MY VACCINE!
Content:
Got it a little over two hours ago and I'm really happy.
I struggled with the idea of taking it because all the possible side effects had my hypochondriac mind on edge but when my dad asked me if I wanted to get it today I said yes on the spur of the moment, and then followed through.
I feel fine at the moment.
The only downside is that the side effects I have to look out for are almost exactly the same as manifestations of my anxiety, but I'm a little too relieved to think about it right now.


Edit- missed word

Post 705: I have illness anxiety disorder, and failed to get my scheduled COVID-19 vaccine a few months ago. Yesterday I bit the bullet and got my first dose! Yayy!
Content:
I'm not an antivaxxer! I believe in modern medicine. 

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay! 

But I'm super proud of myself for biting the bullet and getting the vaccine as I am much more scared of catching COVID-19 than I am of the vaccine.

Post 706: Don‚Äôt trust your anxiety! Today I got proof it isn‚Äôt always right.
Content:
Today I had to do a big presentation at work to some important people. I was quite anxious as I‚Äôm still fairly new-ish to the job and still feel like a huge imposter. I‚Äôve also got a new manager who sat in on the presentation to check everything went okay. 
I did it and when I came out the other side my anxiety was telling me it went terribly. Though I tried not to show it, throughout the presentation, the anxiety was saying, ‚Äúoh god, you‚Äôre bombing, end it so the audience can stop feeling awkward and embarrassed for you.‚Äù I was sure that my manager must be quite disappointed. I fully expected to get a call from her to go over what went wrong and how to improve. 

Instead, she copied me in to an email between her and her boss giving me a ‚Äúshout out‚Äù because I handled the tough questions ‚Äúlike a pro, giving extremely confident and good answers.‚Äù She also added that at the end, the head of department of the client I was presenting to had said the presentation was ‚Äúone of the best‚Äù he‚Äôd seen and he‚Äôd found it ‚Äúextremely useful and insightful‚Äù. 

I feel like she and I were at totally different presentations but it just goes to show, your anxiety is not always right about the situation and your perception does not always align with everyone else‚Äôs. 
Ignore the anxiety voice and just keep on going!

UPDATE: Oh my gosh thank you so much for all the fantastically kind comments and for the awards! I honestly expected maybe 5 people to be interested in this! I‚Äôm glad my experience has resonated with so many people and I really hope it can be an encouraging little story to anyone who is battling with anxiety. I hope it shows anyone who reads it that anxiety isn‚Äôt always reflective of reality. 
It‚Äôs great hearing about everyone else‚Äôs takes on anxiety and perception. What a fantastic community! Thank you everyone for your support! I hope you are all having a great day. :)

Post 707: I got a job that suits my anxiety!
Content:
I'm very ecstatic, I got a job that literally fits around my anxiety! A family member of mine talked to another friend who works at an auto parts shop and she said she completely understands what I'm going through and the company will take me on! All I do is deliver parts and sweep that's it full time 8 to 5! Not only that but they're accommodating for my group therapy! 

Post 708: When people say ‚Äútrust your gut feeling‚Äù means something so different to people with anxiety.
Content:
Not that I expect everyone to understand, but when people ask what your gut feeling is about something, I literally have to shut it down, because my gut feeling is always anxiety??? And I over analyze my gut feeling so much that it turns into negative. I know there‚Äôs obvious things that call for going with your intuition, but people who don‚Äôt have anxiety don‚Äôt realize that we over analyze and fear most decisions. Even when we know what we want, we still fear being wrong. Anybody else? 

Post 709: I‚Äôm so sick of Americans ignoring the pandemic
Content:
I‚Äôm so freaking sick of people acting like Covid isn‚Äôt a thing anymore. It is. It‚Äôs killing people. My moms an RN okay people really are dying. I hate when people don‚Äôt wear masks and completely ignore all social distancing I‚Äôm trying to practice. Don‚Äôt get close to me!!!! Is that so freaking hard! Don‚Äôt get close. Note I‚Äôm wearing a mask and staring at you getting closer like please stop!!!  Ugh. My bf is back at work (in retail) and these customers coming in for unnecessary BS is really setting off my anxiety. I‚Äôm trying to pick him up rn and I heard some guy on his way out complaining about how they‚Äôre closing early and all employees wear masks. Like wtf dude YOU could potentially die from this. Stop going out for random crap you CAN go without! Is it just lack of will power or do you really think this is all a hoax? Whatever. We‚Äôll all have to go back on lockdown soon anyway bc our numbers are rising. 

End rant I guess. I don‚Äôt even feel better.

Post 713: Does anyone else feel physically weak and tired after going through a long period of anxiety that eventually died down temporarily?
Content:
I had a terrible week. I couldn't bring myself to do much of my school work on time because of my anxiety. By Thursday, I managed to calm myself down significantly but I'm feeling the consequences at the moment. My body is sore, my neck and head hurt constantly, and Once 8 pm hits, I feel like dropping unconscious to sleep (that's how tired I am). Is this normal?

Edit: u/ItchyLeftArm mentioned that this effect is "General Adaption Syndrome." Here's an article in case anyone was interested: [https://www.healthline.com/health/general-adaptation-syndrome](https://www.healthline.com/health/general-adaptation-syndrome)

Post 714: I've exercised every day for a week now, and I am so proud of myself!
Content:
A big part of my anxiety come from how others view me and how fat I am. (167 cm and 85 kg) and as with all anxious thoughts, I know they're a lie but, you know. 

So I started running at night so the chances of being seen lowered then on day 3, I was passed by another runner and instead of thinking, I got more motivated. Now I run during dusk which is an improvement I didn't expect.

It's a small step for a regular person, but a giant leap for me.

Edit: Thanks for all the support! It actually gonna make it even easier to run tonight!

Post 716: I miss the days when I could relax, when my mind wasn't always searching for the next thing to be so overly nervous about
Content:
I hear so many friends talk about how middle school was awful for them, but I look back and remember it so fondly. Not because it was my "glory days" or anything like that, but because it was the last time I can remember being able to enjoy life as it comes, and to take things one moment at a time. Just being able to play video games and relax without my mind wandering to ultimately pointless things to be anxious about. Being able to enjoy my hobbies, being able to go out in public without thoughts consuming me about the judgement of every stranger that walks by. I miss the days of being able to do nothing productive, and not be wrought with guilt about it.

I'm 26 now. The best way I can put things is that on paper, my life looks pretty great. Anxiety makes things pretty tough a lot of the time, as I'm sure you can all empathize with. I'm sitting here right now at 1 pm on a Saturday; I don't have work today, all my chores are done, the apartment is spotless, and my grocery shopping is all done, yet just sitting around and wanting to have a lazy day is the hardest thing for me. I suppose I just needed to vent about this. I miss the way my mind used to work.

Tl;dr: I miss being able to relax

Post 717: Went into the store by myself!
Content:
Today I went into the grocery store by myself! I‚Äôve always had a hard time leaving the house and since Covid started it‚Äôs been even harder on me. Normally when I go to the store I need someone to come with me but today I did it by myself! It felt so good to go in by myself without having a panic attack! I‚Äôm proud of myself

It's usually getting in to work that's the hardest.
I've  started zoloft again and hopefully that will get it under control.
But that anxiety wall starts building as the sun goes down.
What am I going to mess up at work tomorrow? What will I get in trouble for?. 

I think it just feels good to share. I'll get over the wall. I just need to make a few runs at it. 

Post 719: I get anxiety from posting/commenting on Reddit.
Content:
This sounds so silly, but can anyone relate? I want to contribute to conversations/post things but I worry about downvotes. How STUPID is that? It shouldn‚Äôt matter. But here I am, worrying that this post will embarrass me. And if I do post or comment, I seriously worry about it and if I look stupid. Like I‚Äôm a complete stranger to everyone anyway. Please tell me I‚Äôm not a total freak. The only time I can comfortably post is if I‚Äôm drunk and that results in me usually deleting them. And I shouldn‚Äôt drink anyway. I just wanted to get that off my chest.

EDIT: I should probably add that I‚Äôve been drinking and that‚Äôs why I had the courage to post this because I‚Äôm a fucking coward.

EDIT #2: I found out this same issue was posted recently. Sorry!

Post 720: Doctor said something profound to me today
Content:
He said, "When you get anxious, your amygdala is activated. You can tell yourself that you're okay and even logically understand you are okay, but your amygdala isn't catching up yet. Just remember that you are okay, and it's just your amygdala needing time to adjust." Basically he's saying that anxiety can persist because our hindbrain and forebrain aren't talking, but it takes time and it will eventually deactivate, so it's important to give ourselves some grace and remember, my amygdala is just aroused right now and it'll go away. Hope this also helps some of you out there.

This job has caused me enough stress that my anxiety has skyrocketed. The amount of anxiety attacks I get, oh boy. I know the solution would be to leave but I can‚Äôt afford that right now. 

But does anyone else always get this gut feeling like oh hey today‚Äôs gonna be a bad day and then it actually does?

Post 723: Anyone else notice that cold air helps calm anxiety?
Content:
When I worked at a restaurant a few years back, I used to get really bad anxiety before I started taking meds. I would go into the walk in freezers for like 10 min and it would calm me down. Idk if it was the time alone to breathe or the cold air that slowed my heart rate but it helped.

Post 724: So I hospitalised myself
Content:
I suffer from existential pure-o anxiety.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. üòÄ

Just wanted to share because, well, I feel pretty alone in this.

Post 726: People without anxiety
Content:
I'm just amazed that there are people in this world who don't suffer anxiety. My dad is one of them. He's always cool as a cucumber(actually makes me feel better to be around him) Why are some of us cursed with this while others go through life taking it all in stride? Unfair!

Post 727: I am so proud of my wife
Content:
My wife has extreme anxiety and when she does something that upsets me, that triggers it. It is super hard for me because I can never express myself in our relationship. 

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn‚Äôt pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn‚Äôt want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn‚Äôt of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said ‚Äú I know you need me tonight but I don‚Äôt know if I am strong enough.‚Äù She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. ‚ÄúBut I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.‚Äù 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn‚Äôt have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight. 

We have been working on this for two and a half years and tonight was a major breakthrough. I am so proud of how far she has come.

For years I lived a very bad life, and now I feel safer it won't come back to bite me.

Post 730: Ukraine Megathread
Content:
Update 4/15: A group of people from this community have created r/UkraineAnxiety

Update 4/13: We have decided to formally close this thread to new comments. We feel that this thread is too taxing for us to moderate and is no longer worth the strain on our mod team like it was back when the situation was brand new. We want to thank everyone who has stuck around to help others stay level-headed through this whole mess!

Update 3/27: Due to all the feedback we got from updates 3/20 and 3/21, we have decided to relax the requirements for posting links. You are free to post a link you want help with or to add commentary on to help others understand it in a less anxious way, and now you can once again post links to good news as well as create good news collections (see the current stickied comment which includes some info on reassurance-seeking behavior). Our one requirement is that you should refrain from posting multiple times over a short period with good news links. If someone does this we will begin taking down their comments as spam. In this case it would be better to put together multiple news links and then post them as a single comment.

Update 3/22: [Click here to view version 2.0 of the list of most helpful comments and resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/t02f1o/comment/i1pkm2f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

*~~Update 3/21: Please see the current stickied comment for more information. It is ok to include a link that is causing you anxiety and asking people to help explain it better. It is also ok to provide a news link alongside your own commentary about the article to help people understand what it is saying in a less anxious way. We're specifically going to remove comments that have one or more news links without asking for help or providing original commentary about the article.~~*

*~~Update 3/20: We have seen a large amount of posts that are mainly about sharing/discussing specific news articles. Please remember to keep everything relevant to anxiety. If a comment is just a news link then we have decided we will have to remove it to keep the thread on topic.~~*

Hi everyone,

It has been requested that we create a megathread for all of the events that have been happening with regards to the conflict in Ukraine. We decided that this is a good idea since so many people have been experiencing extreme anxiety because of it.

We have opted to have this thread be sorted by Best for the time being. To read and respond to the latest comments you can manually change the sort to New. The reason we‚Äôre doing this is because we want the most helpful and most grounded comments to float to the top to help as many people as possible keep their anxiety under control during this difficult time.

For those who want to talk with other anxiety sufferers in more of a live format, feel free to join our official Discord server with this invite link: [https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9](https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9). We have added a special channel to it called "#ukrainediscussion" so people can talk about what's happening and help each other.

As always please remember to be supportive and report any problematic comments so we can remove them as soon as possible.

Thanks!

Content:
This is SO silly but there was a little party today at my university and my stomach was twisting in knots about going so I skipped it even though my sorta-friends were going. I just stayed at home for hours pretty much doing nothing, feeling sad for no reason, but I was under the impression we would all go to a club tonight anyways so I figured i'd save up my social energy for that. And my roommates came home and don't want to go to the club anymore, so now I'm feeling awful and anxious and so sad that I didn't go, I SHOULD have gone and now I have so much regret and anxiety that I missed out. I think I would have had so much fun but yet again I feel like I missed out, and wasted my night. This keeps happening, I really have to get better at forcing myself to just do things...

Post 734: Is it normal to feel physical symptoms of anxiety even if you are not mentally anxious about anything particular?
Content:
I‚Äôve been feeling the common physical symptoms of anxiety but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing it, and it‚Äôs been persistent for a week. 

I also have bad health anxiety so maybe focusing on it has been making me feel weird. I‚Äôm not sure. 

Does anyone else get random heat palpitations, the need to take big breaths and do breathing exercises, and also the feeling of not wanting to do anything? 

I contacted my doctor cause the heart palpitations and the need for breathing exercises usually happen at night.  
But I have to wait two weeks to have a 10 min phone call with my doctor. 

The only times I‚Äôve ever felt this way were times when I was having such bad anxiety, but I don‚Äôt recall the heart palpitations. 

But like I said, I don‚Äôt have reasons to be THIS anxious.. unless I just don‚Äôt realize that I am actually this anxious.

Has anyone else experience this?

Post 735: I got a 4.0 this semester in college!
Content:
 I don't ever like to post anywhere about my grades, but I got two A+s and two A's this semester in college, making it a 4.0 for the semester! 

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think. 

Y'all got this! I hope anyone who's semester just ended had a great one, and everyone else have a great holiday break and happy holidays in general.

They have no idea what we have been through or why we have such disorders. Truly people these days have 0 empathy and yes I mean empathy not respect. No one does anymore not police not nurses and hell definently not most of the general population.

Post 739: I don't know who else needs to hear this but being on medication for your anxiety/depression is ok

Whether it's short term or life long, it's ok! I often feel defeated when I have to get back on my medication.  Like I've failed at being 'normal' but this MY normal.  It allows me to actually laugh again and truly enjoy being alive.  Does it cure it? Absolutely not but it allows me to cope without having a panic attack that lands me in the hospital or catastrophizing about a minor inconvenience. All things in require some sort of work to maintain a quality of  life . A pill will not solve all problems but it definitely aids in the process!

Post 740: Wake up feeling fine until I "remember" to feel anxious... anyone else deal with this?
Content:
Hi all, 

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. I've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where I've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. It's weird - I'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment I realize I'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and I just start accumulating it right then and there. What the hell is up with this? I'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like I can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. 

I think this started while I was having a rough time with a friend recently. That situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed. 

Can anyone relate to this? I'm not sure how to stop triggering this and it's bothering the fuck out of me. I don't want to feel like I can't relax even on the weekend or after work. :/ 

Post 741: Does anyone else randomly start feeling anxious after the sun sets?

My anxiety spikes at night for some reason. I start feeling isolated, sad and anxious for some reason. I used to tell myself it's because i had no friends. I made huge progress over quarantine and made new acquaintances and deepened my friendships. I still feel incredibly lonely. I don't know why.

I don't want people to think I'm this crazy, narcissist that thinks the world revolves around me so I explain that I have pretty severe anxiety issues.... and then I worry that I'm that annoying person who constantly feels the need to justify their actions or statements by leaning heavily on a health issue.... so then I apologize for bringing it up so much. 

My anxiety disorder is causing me anxiety. 

I just left a comment about not being able to sleep at night because my brain won't shut down and I can't stop analyzing everything that I said or did throughout the day. It went from 1 to 0 in less than a minute so I deleted the comment because it sounded whiny and a little crazy. Why do I care so much about what other people think? Why do I worry so much about how I come across to others? It's exhausting.

I'm feeling shity, might delete later. IDK üòò

Post 747: Anyone else ever so hyper aware of other people‚Äôs emotions that you can‚Äôt ever have a good time?
Content:
I live with my best friend and another roommate, and they‚Äôve gone from being super tight to not being able to stand each other. There‚Äôs nothing I can do to fix it and I‚Äôve accepted that, but anytime I‚Äôm in the same room as both of them I get insanely anxious and it makes me not want to be home. Home is the only place I ever really want to be, so it sucks. I‚Äôm overly empathetic to the point where it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt be happy unless everyone around me is happy, and no one around me is ever happy at the same time lol. One of the down sides of mentally ill friend groups I guess.

Post 748: Anyone else find having a medical appointment completely throws off the whole day?

My anxiety just focusing on that appointment unable to focus on my work or anything else which really bugs me because I need to get things done. My anxiety always gets the better of me :(

Post 749: Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?
Content:
It‚Äôs a very specific kind of upset stomach that I get from my anxiety. It‚Äôs not a stomachache, or cramping, or ‚Äúmaybe I ate something bad‚Äù, it‚Äôs literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I‚Äôve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I‚Äôve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it‚Äôs likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don‚Äôt understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn‚Äôt change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don‚Äôt even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don‚Äôt need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I‚Äôm just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn‚Äôt going to fix it. No, I can‚Äôt just ‚Äústop worrying‚Äù, or drink some damn ginger tea. I know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don‚Äôt help.

Post 753: Anyone else feel so anxious yet they instantly "sober up"/relax when other anxious people are in need of your emotional support?
Content:
As the title says, I find that in really tough situations where I'm having a bad day - I instantly feel less tense when I see someone else suffering from severe anxiety. In fact, I always reach out to them (here and irl) and offer them advice which makes me feel better too. Now if only I took my own advice seriously...

Post 754: Does anyone else get super anxious or worried about any form of feedback or criticism?
Content:
Like, to a crippling level. I want to get into writing more, but when I show someone what I wrote, if I get anything more than "nice" or "cool" then I start having bad anxiety. I understand that having your own work criticized is extremely important to grow in just about any aspect, but I am absolutely terrified of it. If I get any positive feedback, I think I didn't earn it or that I'm being patronized. If I get negative feedback in any way, shape or form, I'm extremely discouraged and get too depressed to put in more effort to fix my mistakes, which leads to worse results and therefore worse criticism, and the cycle starts again. 

Or even worse, I'll just straight up refuse to ask anyone for feedback and then when I finally do work up enough courage to ask, it'll be I'm an objectively inferior state than it was before. Is this like, a common thing with anxious people or should I find a therapist lmao

Post 756: How being "gifted" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity
Content:
I was what one would call a "gifted" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed "below average to average". All of those "gifted" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as "gifted" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the "real world". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a "gifted" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?

Post 757: If I say no, it means no. Forcing me out of my shell does NOT work.
Content:
I was at a party and someone was trying to get me to play a vr game. I said no so many times but he picked me up and someone else tried to put the headset on me. I was instantly in panic mode and it took the host seeing me getting upset to get him to stop and put me down. I excused myself to the bathroom because I just knew I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to hold in a breakdown. I got it together a little bit but decided to get some air. On my way out I guess I wasn‚Äôt paying enough attention and the same guy who picked me up, who was now playing the game...accidentally wacks my face. All of this was in front of like 20 people...ended up having my friend bring out my shoes and bag that I had left inside so that I could leave. I just couldn‚Äôt calm down. Still can‚Äôt get it out of my head.hated feeling so helpless in what I originally thought was a safe place.

Post 758: I successfully made a doctor's appointment today!
Content:
Probably the thing I (24f) hate most about my anxiety is that it prevents me from getting things done (buying a new car, making appointments, going to the doctors in general). I procrastinate these basic life things until the absolute last minute. Today I overcame my fear by making an appointment with a new optometrist and I'm so relieved. It's a slow process, but I'm getting there.

Post 759: Does anybody else feel mentally ill with chronic anxiety?
Content:
I know it is a mental illness in itself but I‚Äôm talking about constantly feeling ‚Äúoff‚Äù.. like way less intelligent than you used to be, hard to process your thoughts in to words so they come out jumbled or silly sounding, constant headaches and just feeling like you‚Äôre on autopilot looking in to someone else‚Äôs life.. Idk I‚Äôve been dealing with this for 2+ years and I still find it hard to believe it‚Äôs just anxiety. I‚Äôm terrified it is something else that the doctor‚Äôs are missing which I‚Äôm sure is just anxiety fueled hypochondria lol. 

Post 760: I posted something on Reddit, it blew up. All it did was trigger my anxiety.
Content:
There‚Äôs really no point to this aside from venting. I never post much on Reddit since I tend to get really anxious about it. 

I posted a really nice picture of my grandparents on old school cool and it blew up. The responses were 99% positive and I got a lot of sweet messages, and there was absolutely no reason for me to even be worried. But I spent all day yesterday in a constant state of anxiety. The more traction my post got, the worst my anxiety felt. I really wish I wasn‚Äôt like this, I really hate that something so silly can trigger such a big reaction out of me.

Edit: I know it‚Äôs a small thing, but I feel really understood. I don‚Äôt have many people in my life who I open up to about anxiety so it was really nice to have support even if it‚Äôs just in a Reddit post :)

Post 761: Today I managed not to look away when a girl made eye contact.
Content:
I'm usually very shy and insecure around girls. If one makes eye contact I look down or away immediately especially if I find her cute.

Today though a group of three attractive girls were walking towards me. My eyes met with one of them, I held her gaze for a second or two and she gave me the biggest most beautiful smile! It really made my day and gave me a huge confidence boost.

It made me reconsider what is it that I'm being insecure about? I'm lacking confidence and I don't even know why. Amazing what a simple smile can do!

EDIT: Thanks for the award stranger. I'm glad it cheered someone else up too!

Post 762: Does anyone else have intense fear that they‚Äôll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.
Content:
im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill ‚Äújinx‚Äù it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she‚Äôs independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

*(edit: i did not expect this to get so many attention i dont have time to reply to everybody but just know ive read all the replies and i appreciate them so much! its so comforting to know that im not the only one who feels this way <3 )*

Post 763: Does anyone else with anxiety startle/jump extremely easily?
Content:
My whole life, even the smallest things make me jump. Like listening to a lecture and the professor's mic crackles, or the sink faucet spurts a little bit, stuff like that. Even yesterday, I was squeezing out some toothpaste and a little bit splorked out unexpectedly and I damn near fainted.

Is this an anxiety thing? Constantly feeling like you're about to be jumpscared? It's rather embarrassing, multiple friends have pointed it out and idk how to even explain it.

Post 765: My therapist told me I don't need further therapy sessions!
Content:
I can't believe I am finally here.

The happiest news! After months of CBT, my therapist has finally told me that I no longer need further sessions for my anxiety.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for my therapist's strong and kind guidance, but she also told me to pat myself on the back for actively trying to help myself out of my situation. I went into therapy with a very strong desire to not let anxiety take over my life. I didn't hold back when telling my therapist about my anxiety attacks, every thought that bothered me, and the fears and worries that ate at my mind for hours and days on end. She was sympathetic and really helped me see through the lies my brain is telling me. 

I also did every homework, I took journaling to heart (and in the process found my new healthy hobby), I put in the work in trying out every cognitive restructuring exercise she suggested, from T charts to grounding techniques, really tried to determine which methods would work and which wouldn't, and also tried to get out more and connect with my friends and family.

And now after putting all that work, there is silence in my mind. The storm has passed and I now find myself in the calm I've long sought.

I am not *cured*, however; anxiety is part of the human condition and so cannot be completely eradicated. However, with the help of the techniques I've learned, I've been able to manage it enough for it not to bother me anymore.

There is help. There is light at the end of the tunnel. There is no harm in seeking help, and you deserve all the happiness in the world. I hope everyone in this sub finds peace.

Post 766: Anybody else have anxiety attacks over mundane situations but feel totally numb over more serious situations.
Content:
Like right now I‚Äôm freaking out because my arm is in a little pain and I‚Äôm at a friends house, it‚Äôs 4:00 am and I‚Äôm cold and I don‚Äôt have a blanket but I don‚Äôt wanna wake anybody up by going out of the room to find one or wake them up directly to ask for one. I‚Äôve been pacing back and forth in the same spot for an hour and a half, all because I‚Äôm a bit cold and my arm hurts. Same thing happened when I spilled juice on a table at school. I started hyperventilating over spilled juice. And in slightly more serious situations, I feel totally numb and i disassociate. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not there and my life isn‚Äôt real. I had to confront my professor about a paper I didn‚Äôt turn in yet and when I was about to talk to him, I started to feel lightheaded, my vision stated closing in, my emotions disappeared and I started to disassociate. 

I‚Äôm sorry for this somewhat long rant/DAE question that probably doesn‚Äôt even make sense. I just hate myself for being like this and I just wanted to get me feelings out.

Post 767: Does anyone else miss quarantine?
Content:
Listen I know it‚Äôs controversial. Like many others, I lost my job, I was struggling financially, but the feeling of not having to commit to anything, wake up whenever I want, stay up until late hours, not have to socialize with anyone; I found it so relaxing in a very stressful way. I was scared shitless for the majority of it, I showered and lysol-ed my entire apartment after going to the grocery store. I had a small savings and was able to support myself which I know is not the case for a lot of people, so I do feel bad saying this, but I kind of wish we could have another lock down just so I could feel this sense of freedom again. Am I alone in this feeling?


*edit! I did not expect this to blow up as it did. I feel terrible for those who got more anxiety from staying home, I can completely understand where you‚Äôre coming from if you were in a bad situation. I lived alone at the time with my cat which was a blessing. I know many people didn‚Äôt have the means to relax as I did. And finally, I commend those of you had to work essential jobs during this time and I do not mean to denote that whatsoever. I just loved the feeling of waking up to another day of absolutely nothing on the table. No meetings with friends that I agreed to a week ago that I‚Äôm regretting now, no leaving the house unless necessary, no driving into work, just a state of pure nothingness that helped me heal in a way I never thought it would. Anyway thanks for all your responses, love you all and hope you‚Äôre doing well :)

Post 768: I'd rather die than feel like this
Content:
School started today and I woke up with my heart beating like crazy. I could feel and hear the blood in my brain. Then I ate breakfast- threw it all up. On every break I had to go to the toilet (nausea, sorry if that's gross :/). I finished school- went to the shop with my mum. My heart was still beating very heavily and I felt dizzy. Additionally I got lost without a phone. The shop was huge and I was looking on the right and then to the left trying to spot my mom in the huge crowd of people. With every move of my head I felt more and more dizzy. I thought I was gonna either burst out crying or pass out. I didn't luckily. Just imagine, 17 years old man crying because he got lost in the shop- pathetic, but I was in such a bad state this day that it was really hard to keep myself at least a little bit rational. Well, I found her (yay :,)) I got back home but I am in such a bad state that I am not able to eat anything. I've tried but I feel like throwing up and my heart is still so loud. What shall I do? 

My mum doesn't know. I don't have any medicine.

Post 769: anxiety wastes SOO much time
Content:
I've always been and anxious person, but this past year my anxiety and depression got so much worse.

And now almost a year later, its still there, intrusive thoughts, always overthinking. Honestly for the last year, i don't think there was a single time I was truly at peace, just sitting on the couch and relaxing. Its literally either me being anxious/depressed or me doing my best to distract myself from my thoughts.

And i've just realized how much time i've wasted. I look back this past year. and i dont think about memories i've made, fun i've had, or accomplishments, its just my anxiety taking up all my mental space. And thats energy and time i could've dedicated to learning something, or furthering my goals, or just having fun, but it was all wasted. And even now, as i realize how much i've lost from this, I still can't stop my brain from being so worked up. Its so anoying

Post 770: I DID IT!!!!!!!
Content:
A few days ago I made a post about not leaving the house in months. I spoke about how I was going to challenge myself to go somewhere. Guess what‚Ä¶. i went to my local shopping centre today and I went to a few different shops to get different things!

This is huge for me because I haven‚Äôt been to this shopping centre since August 2023, the last time I was here I felt so dizzy that I thought I was going to pass out. This is the furthest I have travelled in ages! I stayed with my mom on the phone to help me distract myself and to ensure that I didn‚Äôt feel alone. I also left the house at around 9.30 am as the shopping centre is normally very calm at this time. I spent about 20 mins in there. 

I just wanted to share my victory with you guys ü•π

Edit: I am so overwhelmed by all of the positivity üò≠ and it truly warms my heart that my post has encouraged others to try to challenge themselves with more exposure! Towards the end of last year I couldn‚Äôt even leave my BED. If I can do it, I‚Äôm almost certain that you can to! I will keep you guys updated when I make my next outing! Thanks everyone üôÇ
